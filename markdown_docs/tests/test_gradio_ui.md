## ClassDef TestGradioInterface
**TestGradioInterface**: The function of TestGradioInterface is to test the functionality of the GradioInterface class.

**attributes**:
- mock_respond_function: A MagicMock object used for mocking the respond function.
- gradio_interface: An instance of the GradioInterface class initialized with the mock_respond_function.

**Code Description**:
The TestGradioInterface class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the GradioInterface class. It contains two test methods:
1. setUp: Initializes the mock_respond_function and creates an instance of the GradioInterface class.
2. test_setup_gradio_interface: Tests the setup of the Gradio interface by calling the setup_gradio_interface method of the GradioInterface class and asserting that the Blocks class is called.
3. test_respond_function_integration: Ensures that the respond function of the GradioInterface class is integrated correctly by calling the respond method with test messages and asserting that the mock_respond_function is called with the correct parameters.

**Note**:
- The TestGradioInterface class is designed to test the functionality and integration of the GradioInterface class, ensuring that the respond function works as expected.
### FunctionDef setUp(self)
**setUp**: The function of setUp is to initialize the necessary attributes for the test environment before running the test cases.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The `setUp` function is a method used in test cases to set up the required environment or resources before executing the actual test logic. In this specific implementation, the `setUp` function initializes two attributes:
1. `mock_respond_function`: An instance of the `MagicMock` class used for mocking responses.
2. `gradio_interface`: An instance of the `GradioInterface` class created with the `mock_respond_function`.

The `setUp` function is typically called before each test case to ensure a clean and consistent state for testing. In this context, it prepares the necessary objects for testing the functionality related to the `GradioInterface` class.

**Note**:
Developers utilizing this `setUp` function should ensure that any additional setup or configurations required for the test cases are appropriately handled within this method to maintain the integrity and reliability of the test environment.

### FunctionDef test_setup_gradio_interface(self, MockBlocks)
**test_setup_gradio_interface**: The function of test_setup_gradio_interface is to test the setup of the Gradio interface.

**parameters**:
- MockBlocks: A mock object used for testing.

**Code Description**:
The test_setup_gradio_interface function tests the setup of the Gradio interface by calling the setup_gradio_interface method from the GradioInterface class. It then asserts that the MockBlocks object has been called during the process.

The setup_gradio_interface method initializes a Gradio interface by creating input fields for user questions and system instructions, along with buttons for submission and clearing. It also includes sections for displaying responses, embedding recall, and code outputs within the interface. The function configures callback functions for user interactions such as submitting messages and clearing inputs. Finally, it launches the interface with specified settings for sharing and height.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the MockBlocks object is correctly utilized for testing the setup of the Gradio interface.
- Developers can customize the CSS styling and layout of the Gradio interface within the setup_gradio_interface method to suit their design preferences.
***
### FunctionDef test_respond_function_integration(self)
**test_respond_function_integration**: The function of test_respond_function_integration is to test the integration and correct invocation of the respond function.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
- test_msg: A string representing the test message.
- test_system: A string representing the test system message.

**Code Description**:
The test_respond_function_integration function is a unit test that ensures the respond function is integrated and called correctly within the GradioInterface class. It sets up test_msg and test_system variables with sample messages, then calls the respond function of the gradio_interface object with these messages. Finally, it asserts that the mock_respond_function is called with the test_msg and test_system parameters.

**Note**:
It is important to maintain the integrity of the respond function integration and invocation to ensure the proper functioning of the GradioInterface class.
