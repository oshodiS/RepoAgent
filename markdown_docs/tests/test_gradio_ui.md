## ClassDef TestGradioInterface
**TestGradioInterface**: The function of TestGradioInterface is to test the functionality of the GradioInterface class.

**attributes**:
- mock_respond_function: A MagicMock object used for testing.
- gradio_interface: An instance of the GradioInterface class initialized with the mock_respond_function.

**Code Description**:
The TestGradioInterface class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the GradioInterface class. It contains two test methods:
1. setUp: Initializes the mock_respond_function and creates an instance of the GradioInterface class.
2. test_setup_gradio_interface: Tests the setup of the Gradio interface by calling the setup_gradio_interface method of the GradioInterface class and asserting that the Blocks class is called.
3. test_respond_function_integration: Ensures that the respond function of the GradioInterface class is integrated correctly by calling the respond method with test messages and asserting that the mock_respond_function is called with the correct parameters.

**Note**:
- This class uses unittest.TestCase for unit testing.
- The setUp method is used to set up any necessary resources before running each test method.
- The patch decorator is used to mock the Blocks class during testing.
- The test_setup_gradio_interface method tests the setup of the Gradio interface by checking if the Blocks class is called.
- The test_respond_function_integration method tests the integration of the respond function by verifying if the mock_respond_function is called with the correct parameters.
### FunctionDef setUp(self)
**setUp**: The function of setUp is to initialize the mock_respond_function and create an instance of the GradioInterface class for setting up the Gradio user interface.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The setUp function initializes the mock_respond_function using the MagicMock class and creates an instance of the GradioInterface class. The GradioInterface class is responsible for setting up a user interface for interacting with a chatbot system. By instantiating the GradioInterface class, the setUp function prepares the necessary components for user interaction with the chatbot system.

The GradioInterface class contains methods for formatting chatbot responses, cleaning the interface, and configuring the Gradio interface with input fields, buttons, and output display areas. The setUp function ensures that the mock_respond_function and GradioInterface instance are ready for use in the test environment.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the respond function and interface settings according to their requirements. Ensure that the respond function returns the expected outputs for proper display in the Gradio user interface.

### FunctionDef test_setup_gradio_interface(self, MockBlocks)
**test_setup_gradio_interface**: The function of test_setup_gradio_interface is to test the setup of the Gradio interface.

**parameters**:
- MockBlocks: A mock object for testing purposes.

**Code Description**:
The test_setup_gradio_interface function is responsible for testing the setup of the Gradio interface. Within the test, it calls the setup_gradio_interface function from the GradioInterface class to initialize the interface components. It then asserts that the MockBlocks object has been called during the setup process, ensuring that the interface setup functions as expected.

This test function plays a crucial role in verifying that the Gradio interface is correctly set up and ready for interaction with the RepoAgent chat system. By utilizing the MockBlocks object, it simulates the behavior of the setup process and validates the expected function calls within the interface initialization.

**Note**: When running this test, ensure that the MockBlocks object is appropriately configured to mimic the behavior of the Gradio interface setup. This test is essential for validating the functionality of the interface setup process and ensuring a smooth user experience when interacting with the RepoAgent chat system.
***
### FunctionDef test_respond_function_integration(self)
**test_respond_function_integration**: The function of test_respond_function_integration is to test if the respond function is integrated and called correctly.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
- test_msg: A string representing the test message.
- test_system: A string representing the test system message.

**Code Description**:
The test_respond_function_integration function is a unit test that ensures the respond function is correctly integrated and called within the GradioInterface class. It first initializes test_msg with the value "Hello" and test_system with the value "System Message". Then, it calls the respond function of the gradio_interface object with test_msg and test_system as arguments. Finally, it asserts that the mock_respond_function is called with the provided test_msg and test_system.

**Note**:
It is important to update the test_msg and test_system values if the test scenarios change to ensure accurate testing of the respond function integration.
