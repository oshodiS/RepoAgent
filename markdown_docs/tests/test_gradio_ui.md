## ClassDef TestGradioInterface
**TestGradioInterface**: The function of TestGradioInterface is to test the functionality of the GradioInterface class.

**attributes**:
- mock_respond_function: A MagicMock object used for testing.
- gradio_interface: An instance of the GradioInterface class initialized with the mock_respond_function.

**Code Description**:
The TestGradioInterface class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the GradioInterface class. It utilizes the setUp method to set up the necessary objects for testing, including a MagicMock object for mocking the respond function and an instance of the GradioInterface class. The test_setup_gradio_interface method tests the setup of the Gradio interface by calling the setup_gradio_interface method of the GradioInterface class and asserting that the Blocks class is called. The test_respond_function_integration method ensures that the respond function of the GradioInterface class is integrated correctly by calling the respond method with test messages and asserting that the mock_respond_function is called with the correct parameters.

**Note**:
- This class is designed for unit testing the GradioInterface class and should be used in conjunction with a testing framework like unittest.
### FunctionDef setUp(self)
**setUp**: The function of setUp is to initialize the mock_respond_function and create an instance of the GradioInterface class for setting up the Gradio interface.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The setUp function initializes the mock_respond_function using MagicMock and creates an instance of the GradioInterface class by passing the mock_respond_function as a parameter. The GradioInterface class is responsible for creating a user interface for interacting with a chatbot system. It contains methods for formatting and displaying responses, embedding recall, and code snippets. The setup_gradio_interface method within the GradioInterface class sets up the Gradio interface with input fields and buttons for user interaction.

The setUp function plays a crucial role in preparing the necessary components for setting up the Gradio interface, enabling users to input questions, receive responses, view embedding recall, and see code snippets generated by the chatbot.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the CSS styling and functionality of the Gradio interface to tailor it to the specific requirements of their chatbot system.

### FunctionDef test_setup_gradio_interface(self, MockBlocks)
**test_setup_gradio_interface**: The function of test_setup_gradio_interface is to test the setup of the Gradio interface.

**parameters**:
- MockBlocks: A mock object used for testing.

**Code Description**:
The test_setup_gradio_interface function tests the setup of the Gradio interface by calling the setup_gradio_interface method from the GradioInterface class. It then asserts that the MockBlocks object has been called during the setup process.

The setup_gradio_interface function initializes a Gradio interface for users to interact with the chat system. It creates input elements such as textboxes and buttons for user input and interaction. The function formats output sections for response, embedding recall, and code display using HTML and CSS styling. It links input elements to the wrapper_respond function for handling user inputs and displaying formatted outputs on the interface. Additionally, the clean function is linked to a ClearButton element to reset input fields and displayed outputs.

This function is part of the GradioInterface class in the gradio_interface.py file within the chat_with_repo module. It leverages the wrapper_respond function to format the outputs of the respond function and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chat system.

**Note**:
- Users can input questions and optional instructions, submit them using the "Submit" button, and view the formatted responses, embedding recall, and code outputs.
- The "record" button functionality is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet.
- Clicking the "Clear" button resets the input fields and displayed outputs on the Gradio interface.

### FunctionDef test_respond_function_integration(self)
**test_respond_function_integration**: The function of test_respond_function_integration is to test the integration and correct invocation of the respond function.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
- test_msg: A string representing the test message.
- test_system: A string representing the system message.

**Code Description**:
The test_respond_function_integration function is a unit test that ensures the respond function is integrated and called correctly within the GradioInterface class. It sets up test_msg and test_system strings, then calls the respond function of the gradio_interface object with these parameters. Finally, it asserts that the mock_respond_function is called with the test_msg and test_system parameters.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the respond function within the GradioInterface class is correctly integrated and invoked with the expected parameters to maintain the functionality and reliability of the system.
