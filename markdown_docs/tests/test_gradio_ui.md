## ClassDef TestGradioInterface
The function of TestGradioInterface is to test the setup and integration of the Gradio interface.

**attributes**:
- mock_respond_function: A MagicMock object used for mocking the respond function.
- gradio_interface: An instance of GradioInterface initialized with the mock_respond_function.

**Code Description**:
TestGradioInterface is a test class that inherits from unittest.TestCase. It contains two test methods:
1. setUp: Initializes the mock_respond_function and creates an instance of GradioInterface with the mock_respond_function.
2. test_setup_gradio_interface: Tests the setup of the Gradio interface by calling the setup_gradio_interface method of the gradio_interface instance and asserting that the Blocks class is called.
3. test_respond_function_integration: Ensures that the respond function is integrated and called correctly by providing test messages and system messages, then asserting that the mock_respond_function is called with the test messages.

**Note**:
Developers can use TestGradioInterface to verify the setup and integration of the Gradio interface in their applications. The mock_respond_function allows for controlled testing of the respond function integration.
### FunctionDef setUp(self)
**setUp**: The function of setUp is to initialize the mock_respond_function and GradioInterface for testing the Gradio user interface.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The setUp function initializes the mock_respond_function using MagicMock and creates an instance of the GradioInterface class for testing the Gradio user interface. The mock_respond_function is a MagicMock object used for simulating responses, while the GradioInterface class is responsible for setting up the interface for interacting with a chatbot system. By calling the GradioInterface constructor with the mock_respond_function, the test environment is prepared for interaction testing with the chatbot system.

When the setUp function is called in the test environment, it ensures that the necessary components for testing the Gradio user interface are properly initialized. This includes setting up the mock_respond_function to simulate responses and creating an instance of the GradioInterface class to facilitate user interaction with the chatbot system.

**Note**:
Developers can use the setUp function in testing scenarios to prepare the environment for testing the Gradio user interface effectively.

### FunctionDef test_setup_gradio_interface(self, MockBlocks)
**test_setup_gradio_interface**: The function of test_setup_gradio_interface is to test the setup of the Gradio interface.

**parameters**:
- MockBlocks: A mock object used for testing.

**Code Description**:
The test_setup_gradio_interface function tests the setup of the Gradio interface by calling the setup_gradio_interface method of the GradioInterface class. It then asserts that the MockBlocks object has been called during the setup process.

The setup_gradio_interface method initializes a Gradio interface for interacting with the RepoAgent chat system. It configures input elements for user questions and system instructions, along with buttons for submission and clearing. Output elements for response messages, embedding recall, and code display are also set up.

The function links the submit button click event and message submission event to the wrapper_respond function for processing inputs and generating formatted outputs. The clear button is associated with the clean function to reset interface elements. Finally, the Gradio interface is launched with specified height and sharing settings.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the CSS styles align with the interface design requirements.
- The function relies on wrapper_respond and clean functions for input processing and output generation.
- The test_setup_gradio_interface function is used for testing the setup of the Gradio interface.

### FunctionDef test_respond_function_integration(self)
**test_respond_function_integration**: The function of test_respond_function_integration is to test the integration and correct invocation of the respond function.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
- test_msg: A string representing the test message.
- test_system: A string representing the test system message.

**Code Description**:
The test_respond_function_integration function is a unit test method that ensures the respond function is integrated and called correctly within the GradioInterface class. It sets up test messages and a test system message, then calls the respond function of the gradio_interface object with these messages. Finally, it asserts that the mock_respond_function is called with the test_msg and test_system parameters.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the respond function within the GradioInterface class is correctly integrated and called with the expected parameters to maintain the functionality and reliability of the system.
