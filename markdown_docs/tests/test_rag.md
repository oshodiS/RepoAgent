### FunctionDef test_generate_queries(self)
**test_generate_queries**: The function of test_generate_queries is to test the generation of multiple search queries based on a single input query.

**parameters**:
- query_str: a string representing the input query.
- num_queries: an integer specifying the number of search queries to generate (default value is 4).

**Code Description**:
The test_generate_queries function is a unit test that validates the functionality of the generate_queries method in the RepoAssistant class. In this test, a mock response is set up for the OpenAI completion, simulating the generation of three queries ("Query1", "Query2", "Query3") based on the input query "test query" with the expected output of three queries being generated. The test asserts that the length of the generated queries list is equal to 3, ensuring that the generation process is working correctly.

The generate_queries method itself is responsible for creating a prompt template based on the input query and the number of queries requested. It then utilizes a language model to complete the prompt and retrieve a list of generated queries. This function is crucial for generating search queries in response to user input within the RepoAssistant class.

**Note**:
- The test_generate_queries function is a unit test specifically designed to verify the behavior of the generate_queries method.
- It is essential to ensure that the mock response for OpenAI completion is set up correctly to simulate the query generation process accurately.

**Output Example**:
If the generate_queries method successfully generates three queries ("Query1", "Query2", "Query3") based on the input query "test query", the test_generate_queries function will pass, confirming the correct functionality of query generation.

### FunctionDef test_rag(self)
**test_rag**: The function of test_rag is to test the rag method.

**parameters**:
- self: Represents the instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**:
The `test_rag` function is a unit test that validates the functionality of the `rag` method within the `RepoAssistant` class. It sets up a mock response from the `llm.complete` method and then calls the `rag` method with a test query and a list of documents. Finally, it asserts that the response from the `rag` method matches the expected response.

In the project structure, the `test_rag` function is located in the test file `test_rag.py` and is part of the test suite for the `RepoAssistant` class.

**Note**:
Ensure that the `rag` method in the `RepoAssistant` class is functioning correctly and returns the expected response based on the input query and retrieved documents.

**Output Example**:
"If the `rag` method successfully generates a response based on the test query 'test query' and the list of documents ['doc1', 'doc2'], the `test_rag` function will pass the test."
