## ClassDef TestChromaManager
**TestChromaManager**: The function of TestChromaManager is to test the functionality of the ChromaManager class methods.

**attributes**:
- self.mock_client: Mock object representing the ChromaDB client.
- self.mock_collection: Mock object representing a collection in ChromaDB.
- self.chroma_manager: Instance of the ChromaManager class with dummy API key and base.

**Code Description**:
The TestChromaManager class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the ChromaManager class. In the setUp method, a mock ChromaDB client and collection are created. The ChromaManager instance is initialized with dummy API key and base. The test_init method checks if the ChromaManager object is initialized correctly by verifying the existence of the chroma_collection attribute. The test_init_chroma_collection method tests the initialization of the chroma collection by calling the init_chroma_collection method and asserting the creation and retrieval of the collection. The test_create_vector_store method tests the create_vector_store method by mocking an embedding function and verifying the addition of documents and embeddings to the collection.

**Note**:
- The setUp method uses patch decorators to mock external dependencies for testing.
- The test methods use assertions to validate the expected behavior of the ChromaManager class methods.

**Output Example**:
Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value:
- TestChromaManager: PASSED
### FunctionDef setUp(self, MockClient)
**setUp**: The function of setUp is to initialize the MockClient for the ChromaDB Client and set up the necessary attributes for the ChromaManager instance.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the ChromaManager class.
- MockClient: A mock object representing the ChromaDB Client.

**Code Description**:
The setUp function initializes the mock_client attribute by returning the MockClient object. It creates a MagicMock object for mock_collection and sets up the mock_client to return the mock_collection when create_collection or get_collection methods are called. Additionally, it initializes the chroma_manager instance of ChromaManager with dummy API key and base URL.

The setUp function plays a crucial role in setting up the necessary mock objects and attributes for testing the ChromaManager functionality within the test environment.

**Note**:
Developers utilizing the setUp function should ensure the proper setup of the MockClient object to simulate the behavior of the ChromaDB Client. It is essential to verify the interactions and responses of the ChromaManager methods under test scenarios to ensure the functionality of the ChromaManager class.

**Output Example**:
N/A

### FunctionDef test_init(self)
**test_init**: The function of test_init is to test if the object is initialized correctly.

**parameters**: 
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**: 
In this function, the test checks if the chroma_collection attribute of the chroma_manager object is not None. This ensures that the object is properly initialized and the chroma_collection attribute is accessible.

**Note**: 
It is important to ensure that the chroma_manager object is correctly initialized before performing any operations that rely on the chroma_collection attribute to avoid potential errors.
***
### FunctionDef test_init_chroma_collection(self)
**test_init_chroma_collection**: The function of test_init_chroma_collection is to test the initialization of the Chroma collection.

**parameters**:
- No external parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**:
The test_init_chroma_collection function tests the initialization process of the Chroma collection. It calls the init_chroma_collection method of the ChromaManager object to initialize the collection. Subsequently, it asserts that the create_collection and get_collection methods of the mock client object are called once each. Finally, it ensures that the chroma_collection attribute of the ChromaManager object is not None after initialization.

This function plays a crucial role in verifying the proper initialization of the Chroma collection within the test environment. By testing the initialization process, it helps ensure the functionality and correctness of the ChromaManager's collection setup.

**Note**:
- This function is specifically designed for testing the initialization of the Chroma collection and verifying the behavior of the ChromaManager object during this process.
***
### FunctionDef test_create_vector_store(self, MockEmbeddingFunction)
**test_create_vector_store**: The function of test_create_vector_store is to test the create_vector_store method by verifying that it correctly calls the embedding function with the provided Markdown content and adds the documents with their embeddings to the collection.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- MockEmbeddingFunction: Mock object for the embedding function.

**Code Description**:
The test_create_vector_store function sets up a mock embedding function and mock embeddings. It then calls the create_vector_store method of the ChromaManager instance with some Markdown contents. After that, it asserts that the embedding function was called with the provided Markdown contents and checks if the documents with their embeddings were added to the collection correctly.

In the context of the project, this test function ensures the proper functionality of the create_vector_store method within the ChromaManager class. By using mock objects, it isolates the testing of this specific method and validates its behavior independently.

**Note**:
- This test function is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the create_vector_store method and ensuring its correct interaction with the embedding function and collection.
- It is essential to update the test case if there are any changes in the implementation of the create_vector_store method to maintain accurate testing coverage.

**Output Example**: 
No direct output is generated by this test function. The success of the test is determined by the assertions made within the function.
