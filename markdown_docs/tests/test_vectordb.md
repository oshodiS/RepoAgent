## ClassDef TestChromaManager
**TestChromaManager**: The function of TestChromaManager is to test the functionality of the ChromaManager class methods.

**attributes**:
- mock_client: Represents a mock ChromaDB client for testing purposes.
- mock_collection: Represents a mock collection object for testing.
- chroma_manager: An instance of the ChromaManager class with dummy API key and base.

**Code Description**:
The TestChromaManager class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the ChromaManager class methods. In the setUp method, a mock ChromaDB client is created, and necessary mock objects are set up for testing. The ChromaManager instance is initialized with dummy API key and base in the setUp method as well.

The test_init method checks if the ChromaManager object is initialized correctly by verifying the existence of the chroma_collection attribute.

The test_init_chroma_collection method tests the initialization of the chroma collection by calling the init_chroma_collection method and asserting that the create_collection and get_collection methods of the mock client are called once each. It also ensures that the chroma_collection attribute is not None after initialization.

The test_create_vector_store method tests the create_vector_store method of the ChromaManager class. It sets up a mock embedding function and mock embeddings, then calls the create_vector_store method with sample document contents. The method asserts that the mock_embedding_function is called with the document contents and that the add method of the mock collection is called with the expected parameters.

**Note**:
- This class uses unittest.TestCase for unit testing.
- Mock objects are utilized for testing the interactions with external dependencies.

**Output Example**:
A successful test run of the TestChromaManager class would show all test methods passing without any assertion errors.
### FunctionDef setUp(self, MockClient)
**setUp**: The function of setUp is to set up a mock for the ChromaDB Client and initialize the ChromaManager with specific parameters.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- MockClient: A mock client object.

**Code Description**:
The `setUp` function initializes the mock client for the ChromaDB Client by setting up the mock client and collection. It then creates and sets up the `ChromaManager` instance with a dummy API key and base URL. This function is crucial for preparing the environment for testing ChromaManager functionalities.

The `setUp` function is utilized in the testing environment to mock the behavior of the ChromaDB Client and set up the necessary components for testing the ChromaManager functionalities. By using a mock client, the actual interactions with the ChromaDB are simulated, ensuring controlled and predictable testing scenarios.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the `MockClient` object passed to the `setUp` function is correctly configured to mimic the behavior of the ChromaDB Client. Additionally, the parameters used to initialize the `ChromaManager` instance should be adjusted based on the specific testing requirements.

**Output Example**:
N/A

### FunctionDef test_init(self)
**test_init**: The function of test_init is to test if the object is initialized correctly.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: In this Function, the code checks if the chroma_collection attribute of the chroma_manager object is not None, indicating that the object has been initialized properly.
**Note**: Ensure that the chroma_manager object is properly instantiated before running this test to validate the initialization process.
***
### FunctionDef test_init_chroma_collection(self)
**test_init_chroma_collection**: The function of test_init_chroma_collection is to test the initialization of the Chroma collection.

**parameters**: 
- No external parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**:
The test_init_chroma_collection function verifies the correct initialization of the Chroma collection by calling the init_chroma_collection method of the ChromaManager class. It then asserts that the create_collection and get_collection methods of the mock client object are called exactly once each. Additionally, it ensures that the chroma_collection attribute of the ChromaManager object is not None after initialization.

This function plays a crucial role in ensuring that the initialization process of the Chroma collection functions as expected, allowing for subsequent operations to be performed on the collection with confidence.

**Note**: 
- The test_init_chroma_collection function is part of the test suite for the ChromaManager class and is designed to validate the behavior of the init_chroma_collection method under test conditions.
- By utilizing mock objects for the client interactions, the function isolates the testing of the ChromaManager's initialization logic from external dependencies, ensuring reliable and consistent test results.
***
### FunctionDef test_create_vector_store(self, MockEmbeddingFunction)
**test_create_vector_store**: The function of test_create_vector_store is to test the create_vector_store method by verifying that it correctly calls the embedding function with the Markdown content and adds the documents with corresponding embeddings to the collection.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
- MockEmbeddingFunction: A mock object representing the embedding function.

**Code Description**:
The test_create_vector_store function sets up a mock embedding function and defines mock embeddings. It then creates mock contents and invokes the create_vector_store method of the ChromaManager object. The function asserts that the embedding function is called with the mock contents and checks if the documents with embeddings are added to the collection correctly.

This test function ensures that the create_vector_store method behaves as expected when processing Markdown content and storing it in Chroma. It validates the integration between the create_vector_store method and the embedding function.

**Note**:
Ensure that the create_vector_store method correctly processes the Markdown content and associates the embeddings with the documents for storage in Chroma.

**Output Example**:
No explicit return value as this is a test function. The output is in the form of test assertions to confirm the behavior of the create_vector_store method.
