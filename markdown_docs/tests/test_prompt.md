### FunctionDef tearDown(self)
**tearDown**: The function of tearDown is to stop the patches that have been applied during the test execution.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: In the tearDown function, the openai_patch and json_processor_patch are stopped using the stop() method. This ensures that any patches applied during the test are properly cleaned up and no longer affect the environment.
**Note**: It is important to include the tearDown function in test cases where patches are applied to ensure proper cleanup and prevent interference with other tests.
***
### FunctionDef test_keyword(self)
**test_keyword**: The function of test_keyword is to validate that the keyword function correctly retrieves keywords based on a given query.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly to this test function.

**Code Description**:
The test_keyword function sets up a mock response for the llm object's complete method to simulate the retrieval of keywords "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3" based on a test query. It then calls the keyword function of the text_analysis_tool object with the query "test query" and asserts that "keyword1" is present in the list of keywords returned by the function.

This test ensures that the keyword function successfully extracts and returns keywords from a given query, validating its functionality within the text_analysis_tool object.

**Note**:
- This test function relies on the correct behavior of the keyword function within the text_analysis_tool object.
- It is essential to maintain the integrity of the mock response set up for the llm object to ensure the test's accuracy.

**Output Example**:
If the keyword function operates as expected, the output of this test may include the keyword "keyword1" in the list of extracted keywords.
***
### FunctionDef test_tree(self)
**test_tree**: The function of test_tree is to verify that the tree structure generated by the TextAnalysisTool's tree function matches the expected tree structure.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed to this function explicitly.

**Code Description**:
The test_tree function sets up a mock response from the llm model to return "tree structure" when the tree function of the TextAnalysisTool is called with the query "test query". It then calls the tree function with the query and asserts that the returned tree structure matches the expected "tree structure".

This test ensures that the tree function of the TextAnalysisTool is correctly generating the expected tree structure based on the input query.

**Note**:
This test function relies on the correct behavior of the tree function within the TextAnalysisTool and the setup of the mock response from the llm model.

**Output Example**:
If the tree function works as expected, the test_tree function will pass without any assertion errors.
***
### FunctionDef test_format_chat_prompt(self)
**test_format_chat_prompt**: The function of test_format_chat_prompt is to test the formatting of a chat prompt by checking if the formatted prompt contains the user message.

**parameters**:
- message: Represents the user message in the chat prompt.
- instruction: Represents the system instruction in the chat prompt.

**Code Description**:
The `test_format_chat_prompt` function tests the `format_chat_prompt` function from the `TextAnalysisTool` class. It calls the `format_chat_prompt` function with a sample message and instruction, then asserts that the formatted prompt contains the user message. This test ensures that the chat prompt is correctly formatted with the user message included.

The `format_chat_prompt` function itself constructs a formatted chat prompt string by combining the system instruction prefixed with "System:", the user message prefixed with "User:", and an empty "Assistant:" placeholder. This formatted prompt is then returned by the function.

In the project structure, the `format_chat_prompt` function is utilized within the `respond` method of the `RepoAssistant` class in the `rag.py` file. The `respond` method uses the `format_chat_prompt` function to format the chat prompt before further processing, such as generating queries, retrieving documents, and generating responses within the chatbot functionality context.

**Note**:
- Ensure to provide appropriate values for the `message` and `instruction` parameters when calling the `format_chat_prompt` function to generate the desired chat prompt format.
- The `test_format_chat_prompt` function serves as a unit test to verify the correct behavior of the `format_chat_prompt` function in formatting chat prompts.
***
### FunctionDef test_queryblock(self, mock_jsonsearch)
**test_queryblock**: The function of test_queryblock is to test the queryblock function of the TextAnalysisTool class.

**parameters**:
- mock_jsonsearch: A mock object used to simulate the behavior of the JsonSearch class.

**Code Description**:
The test_queryblock function sets up a mock response for the search_in_json_nested method of the mock_jsonsearch object. It then calls the queryblock method of the TextAnalysisTool class with a test message and asserts that the returned result matches the expected code content.

The queryblock method of the TextAnalysisTool class is responsible for searching for specific text within a JSON file and retrieving relevant code content and markdown content based on the search criteria. It utilizes the search_code_contents_by_name method from the JsonFileProcessor class to perform the search operation. The function ensures robust error handling for exceptions like FileNotFoundError and JSONDecodeError.

The queryblock function is typically used within the respond method of the RepoAssistant class to search for text within JSON files and generate appropriate responses based on the search results.

**Note**:
- Ensure the message provided aligns with the structure of the JSON data for accurate search results.
- Proper exception handling is crucial to maintain the functionality and reliability of the search process.

**Output Example**:
If matching items are found:
(["Matching code content 1", "Matching code content 2"], ["Matching markdown content 1", "Matching markdown content 2"])

If no matching items are found:
(["No matching item found."], ["No matching item found."])

### FunctionDef test_nerquery(self)
**test_nerquery**: The function of test_nerquery is to test the nerquery function of the TextAnalysisTool class.

**parameters**:
- self: The object itself.

**Code Description**:
The test_nerquery function is a unit test that verifies the functionality of the nerquery method in the TextAnalysisTool class. In this test, a mock response is set up for the language model's completion function to return "function_name" when called. The nerquery method is then invoked with a test message, and the returned value is compared to the expected "function_name". Additionally, the assertion checks if the debug method of the logger manager is called.

This test ensures that the nerquery function correctly processes the input message and interacts with the language model to return the expected response.

**Note**:
- This test is essential for validating the behavior of the nerquery method within the TextAnalysisTool class.
- It helps maintain the functionality and reliability of the nerquery method during code changes and updates.

**Output Example**:
An example return value from the test_nerquery function could be: "function_name"
