### FunctionDef setUp(self)
**setUp**: The function of setUp is to set up necessary mocks and patches for OpenAI and JsonFileProcessor, and initialize the TextAnalysisTool with mocked dependencies.

**parameters**:
- self: Represents the instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The setUp function initializes mocks for the OpenAI language model and JsonFileProcessor, patches the classes, starts the patches, and then initializes the TextAnalysisTool with the mocked dependencies. This function ensures that the necessary dependencies are mocked and set up correctly for testing the TextAnalysisTool functionalities.

The setUp function is crucial for preparing the environment for testing the TextAnalysisTool class by providing mock objects for external dependencies. By setting up the mocks and patches, the function ensures that the TextAnalysisTool operates as expected in a controlled testing environment.

**Note**: It is essential to ensure that the mocks and patches are appropriately set up and started before testing the TextAnalysisTool functionalities to avoid any interference from external dependencies.

**Output Example**: N/A

### FunctionDef tearDown(self)
**tearDown**: The function of tearDown is to stop the patches that have been applied during the test setup.

**parameters**: 
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**: 
The tearDown function is a method used in test cases to clean up resources or revert changes made during the test setup. In this specific implementation, the function stops the patches that were applied using the openai_patch and json_processor_patch attributes.

When this function is called, it stops the patches by invoking the stop() method on each of the patch objects. This ensures that any modifications or overrides made by the patches are reverted, allowing for a clean state before the test case is completed.

**Note**: 
Developers should ensure that any necessary cleanup or restoration of resources is implemented within the tearDown function to maintain the integrity and consistency of the test environment.
***
### FunctionDef test_keyword(self)
**test_keyword**: The function of test_keyword is to verify that the keyword "keyword1" is present in the list of keywords generated by the text_analysis_tool.keyword function for a given query.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are directly passed to this test function.

**Code Description**:
The test_keyword function sets up a mock response for the llm.complete method to return "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3" when called within the text_analysis_tool.keyword function with the query "test query". It then retrieves the list of keywords generated by the keyword function and asserts that "keyword1" is present in the list.

This test function is essential for ensuring that the keyword extraction functionality of the text_analysis_tool.keyword function works correctly within the project's codebase.

**Note**:
Ensure that the mock response set up for the llm.complete method aligns with the expected keywords for the given query to validate the keyword extraction process accurately.

**Output Example**:
If the keyword function successfully generates the list "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3" for the query "test query", the test_keyword function will pass without any assertion errors.
***
### FunctionDef test_tree(self)
**test_tree**: The function of test_tree is to test the tree function of the TextAnalysisTool class by asserting the generated tree structure.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly to this test function.

**Code Description**:
The test_tree function sets up a mock response for the llm object's complete method to return "tree structure" when called. It then calls the tree method of the TextAnalysisTool class with the query "test query" and asserts that the returned tree structure matches the expected "tree structure".

This test function ensures that the tree method of the TextAnalysisTool class correctly generates the tree structure based on the input query.

**Note**:
Ensure that the mock_llm object is properly configured to simulate the behavior of the llm object before running this test to avoid any test failures related to the completion process.

**Output Example**:
If the tree method of the TextAnalysisTool class works as expected, the test_tree function will pass without any assertion errors.
***
### FunctionDef test_format_chat_prompt(self)
**test_format_chat_prompt**: The function of test_format_chat_prompt is to test the formatting of a chat prompt message by checking if the user's message is included in the formatted prompt.

**parameters**:
- self: Represents the instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**:
The `test_format_chat_prompt` function tests the `format_chat_prompt` method of the `TextAnalysisTool` class. It calls the `format_chat_prompt` method with a sample user message and system instruction, then asserts that the formatted prompt contains the user's message in the correct format. This test ensures that the `format_chat_prompt` method correctly constructs the chat prompt message as expected.

The `format_chat_prompt` method is responsible for generating a formatted prompt message for a chat system. It takes in a user message and a system instruction, combines them with specific formatting, and returns the formatted prompt. This function is an essential part of facilitating communication between the user and the chatbot assistant within the repository system.

**Note**:
Ensure that the `format_chat_prompt` method functions correctly by verifying that the user's message is included in the formatted prompt during testing.
***
### FunctionDef test_queryblock(self, mock_jsonsearch)
**test_queryblock**: The function of test_queryblock is to test the queryblock function of the TextAnalysisTool class.

**parameters**:
- mock_jsonsearch: A mock object used to simulate the behavior of the JsonSearch class.

**Code Description**:
The test_queryblock function tests the queryblock function of the TextAnalysisTool class. It sets up the mock_jsonsearch object to return a specific value when the search_in_json_nested method is called. Then, it calls the queryblock method with a test message and asserts that the result matches the expected code content.

The queryblock function itself is responsible for searching for specific text within a JSON file loaded data structure. It extracts relevant code content based on the search criteria provided in the message parameter. The function utilizes the search_code_contents_by_name method from the JsonFileProcessor class to perform the search and returns the matching code content.

This function is commonly used in the respond method of the RepoAssistant class in the rag.py file. In the respond method, queryblock is employed to search for specific keywords within the JSON file based on the message and instruction provided.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the message aligns with the structure of the JSON data for accurate search results.
- Proper error handling is essential to manage exceptions effectively.

**Output Example**:
(["test_code"], ["Matching markdown content"])
***
### FunctionDef test_nerquery(self)
**test_nerquery**: The function of test_nerquery is to test the nerquery function of the TextAnalysisTool class.

**parameters**:
- self: The object itself.

**Code Description**:
The test_nerquery function is a unit test that validates the functionality of the nerquery method in the TextAnalysisTool class. In this test, a mock response is set up for the language model's completion function. The nerquery method is then called with a test message, and the returned value is compared to the expected value. Additionally, the assertion checks if the debug method of the logger manager is called during the execution of the nerquery method.

This test ensures that the nerquery method behaves as expected, returning the correct function name based on the input message and triggering the debug logging as intended.

**Note**:
- This test function is part of the test suite for the TextAnalysisTool class and serves to verify the functionality of the nerquery method.
- It is important to maintain the mock setup for the language model completion function to isolate the test and focus on the specific behavior of the nerquery method.

**Output Example**:
If the test is successful, it indicates that the nerquery method correctly extracts the function name "function_name" from the input message "test message" and triggers the debug logging.
