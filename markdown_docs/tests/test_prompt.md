### FunctionDef setUp(self)
**setUp**: The function of setUp is to set up necessary mocks and patches for OpenAI and JsonFileProcessor, and initialize the TextAnalysisTool with mocked dependencies.

**parameters**:
- self: Represents the instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The setUp function initializes the following components:
1. Mocks the OpenAI and JsonFileProcessor classes using MagicMock.
2. Patches the classes with the respective mocks.
3. Starts the patches for OpenAI and JsonFileProcessor.
4. Initializes the TextAnalysisTool with the mocked OpenAI language model and a database path.

The TextAnalysisTool is a class that provides various text analysis functionalities such as keyword extraction, tree structure generation, chat prompt formatting, code block search, search result conversion to Markdown format, and relevant class or function name extraction. It is utilized in the project for handling text analysis tasks.

**Note**: Ensure the proper setup of mocks and patches before initializing the TextAnalysisTool to avoid any dependency-related issues.

**Output Example**: N/A
***
### FunctionDef tearDown(self)
**tearDown**: The function of tearDown is to stop the patches that have been applied during the test execution.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
**Code Description**: In the tearDown function, the openai_patch and json_processor_patch are stopped using the stop() method. This ensures that any patches applied during the test are properly cleaned up and removed.
**Note**: It is important to call the tearDown function at the end of each test to ensure proper cleanup of resources and patches used during the test execution.
***
### FunctionDef test_keyword(self)
**test_keyword**: The function of test_keyword is to validate that the keyword function correctly extracts keywords from a given query.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly to the test_keyword function.

**Code Description**:
The test_keyword function sets up a mock response for the llm.complete method to simulate the generation of keywords "keyword1, keyword2, keyword3" based on a test query. It then calls the keyword function of the text_analysis_tool object with the query "test query" and asserts that "keyword1" is present in the list of extracted keywords.

This test ensures that the keyword function accurately retrieves keywords from a query and that the expected keyword is included in the output list.

**Note**:
- This test relies on the correct behavior of the keyword function and the mock response from llm.complete to validate the keyword extraction process.
- It is essential to maintain the integrity of the keyword function and its dependencies for the test to function as expected.

**Output Example**:
If the keyword function successfully extracts keywords from the query "test query", the expected output would include "keyword1" in the list of keywords.
***
### FunctionDef test_tree(self)
**test_tree**: The function of test_tree is to test the tree generation functionality of the TextAnalysisTool class.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly to this test function.

**Code Description**:
The `test_tree` function sets up a mock response for the `llm.complete` method, then calls the `tree` function of the TextAnalysisTool class with a test query "test query". It finally asserts that the returned tree structure matches the expected value "tree structure". This test ensures the correct functioning of the tree generation feature in the TextAnalysisTool.

**Note**:
Ensure that the `llm.complete` method is properly mocked to control the response for testing the `tree` function accurately.

**Output Example**:
If the test query "test query" generates a tree structure "tree structure", the test case will pass successfully.
***
### FunctionDef test_format_chat_prompt(self)
**test_format_chat_prompt**: The function of test_format_chat_prompt is to generate a formatted prompt message for a chat conversation.

**parameters**:
- message: Represents the user's message in the chat.
- instruction: Represents the system's instruction or message in the chat.

**Code Description**:
The `test_format_chat_prompt` function takes in a user message and a system instruction, then constructs a formatted prompt message for a chat conversation. It creates a prompt string that includes the system's instruction, the user's message, and a placeholder for the assistant's response. The function then returns this formatted prompt.

This function is utilized in the `respond` method of the `RepoAssistant` class located in `repo_agent\chat_with_repo\rag.py`. In the `respond` method, the `format_chat_prompt` function is called to generate a prompt for a chat conversation. The generated prompt is further processed to extract keywords, generate queries, retrieve relevant documents, and formulate a response using the RAG model. The function also handles the extraction of code blocks and markdown content based on the chat prompt and response.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `message` and `instruction` parameters are provided correctly to generate the desired prompt.
- The function focuses on formatting the chat prompt and does not handle the entire chatbot logic.
***
### FunctionDef test_queryblock(self, mock_jsonsearch)
**test_queryblock**: The function of test_queryblock is to test the queryblock function of the TextAnalysisTool class.

**parameters**:
- mock_jsonsearch: A mock object used to simulate the behavior of the jsonsearch module.

**Code Description**:
The test_queryblock function sets up a mock response for the search_in_json_nested method of the mock_jsonsearch object. It then calls the queryblock method of the text_analysis_tool object with a test message and asserts that the returned result matches the expected code content.

The queryblock method of the TextAnalysisTool class is responsible for searching for specific text within a JSON file and retrieving matching code content and markdown content. It utilizes the search_code_contents_by_name function to perform the search operation. The function returns the search result and markdown content based on the search outcome.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the mock_jsonsearch object is correctly set up to mimic the behavior of the jsonsearch module for accurate testing of the queryblock function.

**Output Example**:
If the test message "test message" results in a match:
(["test_code"], ["md_content1"])

If no matching items are found:
(["No matching item found."], ["No matching item found."])
***
### FunctionDef test_nerquery(self)
**test_nerquery**: The function of test_nerquery is to test the nerquery function of the TextAnalysisTool class.

**parameters**:
- self: The object itself.

**Code Description**:
The test_nerquery function is a unit test that validates the functionality of the nerquery method in the TextAnalysisTool class. In this test, a mock response is set up for the llm.complete method to return "function_name" when called. The nerquery method is then invoked with the message "test message", and the obtained function name is compared with the expected value "function_name" using the assertEqual method. Additionally, the debug method of the logger manager is checked for being called using assert_called.

The nerquery method itself is responsible for constructing a query based on specific instructions provided in the function. It utilizes the llm.complete method to retrieve a response based on the constructed query. The function returns the obtained response from the completion of the query.

This test ensures that the nerquery method behaves as expected and returns the correct function name based on the input message.

**Note**:
Ensure that the mock objects and assertions are correctly set up for testing the nerquery method.

**Output Example**:
"function_name"
