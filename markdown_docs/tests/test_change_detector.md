## ClassDef TestChangeDetector
**TestChangeDetector**: The function of TestChangeDetector is to perform unit tests for the ChangeDetector class methods.

**attributes**: 
· test_repo_path: Path to the test repository.
· repo: Initialized Git repository for testing.

**Code Description**: 
The TestChangeDetector class is a unit test class that inherits from unittest.TestCase. It contains methods to test the functionality of the ChangeDetector class methods. 
- The setUpClass method sets up the test repository, initializes a Git repository, configures Git user information, creates test files, and simulates Git operations.
- The test_get_staged_pys method creates a new Python file, stages it, and checks if the file is in the staged files list.
- The test_get_unstaged_mds method modifies a Markdown file without staging it and checks if the file is in the unstaged files list.
- The test_add_unstaged_mds method ensures there is an unstaged Markdown file, adds it using ChangeDetector, and verifies that the file is staged.
- The tearDownClass method cleans up the test repository by closing the repository and removing the test repository directory.

**Note**: 
- This class is designed for testing the ChangeDetector class methods and should be used in conjunction with the ChangeDetector class for comprehensive testing.
### FunctionDef setUpClass(cls)
**setUpClass**: The function of setUpClass is to set up a test environment by creating a test repository, initializing a Git repository, configuring Git user information, creating test files, and simulating Git operations to add and commit files.

**parameters**:
- cls: Represents the class itself.

**Code Description**:
The setUpClass function first defines the path for the test repository by joining the directory path with 'test_repo'. It then checks if the test repository folder does not exist, it creates the folder. Next, it initializes a Git repository in the test repository path. Following this, it configures the Git user email and name. The function proceeds to create two test files, 'test_file.py' containing a Python print statement and 'test_file.md' containing a Markdown heading. Finally, it simulates Git operations by adding all files and making an initial commit.

**Note**:
- This function is typically used in unit testing to set up a specific environment before running test cases.
