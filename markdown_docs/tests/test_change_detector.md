## ClassDef TestChangeDetector
**TestChangeDetector**: The function of TestChangeDetector is to perform unit tests for the ChangeDetector class methods.

**attributes**:
- test_repo_path: Path to the test repository.
- repo: Initialized Git repository for testing.

**Code Description**:
The TestChangeDetector class contains methods to test the functionality of the ChangeDetector class. 
1. The setUpClass method sets up the test repository, initializes a Git repository, configures Git user information, creates test files, and simulates Git operations by adding and committing files.
2. The test_get_staged_pys method creates a new Python file, stages it, uses ChangeDetector to check staged Python files, and asserts the presence of the new file in the staged files list.
3. The test_get_unstaged_mds method modifies a Markdown file without staging it, uses ChangeDetector to get unstaged Markdown files, and asserts the presence of the modified file in the unstaged files list.
4. The test_add_unstaged_mds method ensures there is an unstaged Markdown file, adds the unstaged file using ChangeDetector, checks if the file is staged, and asserts that there are no remaining unstaged Markdown files after the add operation.
5. The tearDownClass method cleans up the test repository by closing the Git repository and removing the test repository directory.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the test repository path is correctly set up before running the test methods.
- The test methods rely on the ChangeDetector class for testing Git operations, so ensure the ChangeDetector class is functioning correctly before running these tests.
### FunctionDef setUpClass(cls)
**setUpClass**: The function of setUpClass is to set up a test environment by creating a test repository, initializing a Git repository, configuring Git user information, creating test files, and simulating Git operations to add and commit files.

**parameters**:
- cls: The class object representing the test case class.

**Code Description**:
The setUpClass function first defines the path for the test repository by joining the directory path with 'test_repo'. It then checks if the test repository folder exists and creates it if it does not. Next, it initializes a Git repository in the test repository path. The function proceeds to configure the Git user information with a specified email and name. Following this, it creates two test files, 'test_file.py' and 'test_file.md', with specific content in the test repository. Finally, it simulates Git operations by adding all files and committing them with an initial commit message.

**Note**:
- This function is typically used in test classes to set up a test environment before running test cases.
- Ensure that the necessary modules (os, Repo) are imported before using this function.

### FunctionDef test_get_staged_pys(self)
**test_get_staged_pys**: The purpose of the test_get_staged_pys function is to test the functionality of the get_staged_pys method in the ChangeDetector class. It verifies whether the method correctly retrieves the added Python files in the repository that have been staged.

**Parameters**:
- self: The instance of the TestChangeDetector class.

**Code Description**:
The test_get_staged_pys function is a unit test that ensures the get_staged_pys method in the ChangeDetector class functions as expected. It follows a specific workflow to create a new Python file, stage it, and then checks if the file is correctly identified as staged.

First, the function creates a new Python file named 'new_test_file.py' in the test repository path. It writes a simple print statement to the file. The file is then added to the staging area using the git add command.

Next, an instance of the ChangeDetector class is created, passing the test repository path as a parameter. This class is responsible for handling file differences and change detection in the repository.

The get_staged_pys method is called on the ChangeDetector instance to retrieve the added Python files that have been staged. The method utilizes the GitPython library to compare the staging area (index) with the original HEAD commit. It identifies the newly created files by checking the change type in the GitPython diff object.

The function then asserts that the 'new_test_file.py' is present in the dictionary of staged files returned by the get_staged_pys method. It compares the file paths in the dictionary with the basename of the staged files to account for any differences in the directory structure.

Finally, the function prints the staged Python files to provide visibility into the test results.

**Note**:
- The test_get_staged_pys function is part of the TestChangeDetector class and serves as a unit test for the get_staged_pys method in the ChangeDetector class.
- It is important to ensure that the test repository path is correctly set before running this test.
- The test repository should be in a clean state before running this test to avoid interference from other changes.
- The get_staged_pys method relies on the GitPython library to interact with the Git repository.
- The test_get_staged_pys function can be used as a reference for testing the get_staged_pys method in other scenarios.

**Output Example**:
```
test_get_staged_pys: Staged Python files: {'new_test_file.py': True}
```

Please note that the provided documentation is based on the code analysis and may not cover all possible scenarios or edge cases. It is recommended to review and test the code thoroughly before using it in a production environment.

### FunctionDef test_get_unstaged_mds(self)
**test_get_unstaged_mds**: The function of test_get_unstaged_mds is to test the functionality of retrieving unstaged Markdown files in a Git repository.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the TestChangeDetector class.

**Code Description**:
The `test_get_unstaged_mds` function is a unit test that verifies the behavior of the `get_to_be_staged_files` method in the `ChangeDetector` class. It ensures that the method correctly retrieves the unstaged Markdown files in the repository.

The function first modifies a Markdown file by appending additional content to it. It then creates an instance of the `ChangeDetector` class, passing the repository path as an argument. The `get_to_be_staged_files` method is called to retrieve the unstaged files in the repository.

The function asserts that the modified file is present in the list of unstaged files returned by the `get_to_be_staged_files` method. It also prints the list of unstaged Markdown files for reference.

This function is called by the `test_add_unstaged_mds` method in the same class to ensure that there is at least one unstaged Markdown file before testing the `add_unstaged_files` method.

**Note**:
- The function relies on the `ChangeDetector` class and its `get_to_be_staged_files` method to retrieve the unstaged Markdown files.
- It performs assertions to verify the correctness of the retrieved files.
- The printed list of unstaged Markdown files serves as a visual confirmation of the retrieved files.

**Output Example**:
Unstaged Markdown files: ['test_file.md']


***
### FunctionDef test_add_unstaged_mds(self)
**test_add_unstaged_mds**: The function of test_add_unstaged_mds is to test the functionality of adding unstaged Markdown files to the staging area in a Git repository.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the TestChangeDetector class.

**Code Description**:
The `test_add_unstaged_mds` function is a unit test that verifies the behavior of the `add_unstaged_files` method in the `ChangeDetector` class. It ensures that the method correctly adds unstaged Markdown files to the staging area.

The function first calls the `test_get_unstaged_mds` method to ensure that there is at least one unstaged Markdown file in the repository. It then creates an instance of the `ChangeDetector` class, passing the repository path as an argument. The `add_unstaged_files` method is called to add the unstaged files to the staging area.

The function retrieves the list of files that are still unstaged after the addition. It asserts that the length of this list is 0, indicating that all unstaged Markdown files have been successfully added to the staging area.

Finally, the function prints the number of remaining unstaged Markdown files after the add operation for reference.

This function is called by the test runner to verify the correctness of the `add_unstaged_files` method and ensure that unstaged Markdown files are properly handled.

**Note**:
- The function relies on the `ChangeDetector` class and its `add_unstaged_files` method to add unstaged Markdown files to the staging area.
- It performs assertions to verify the correctness of the added files.
- The printed number of remaining unstaged Markdown files serves as a visual confirmation of the successful addition to the staging area.
***
### FunctionDef tearDownClass(cls)
**tearDownClass**: The function of tearDownClass is to clean up the test repository by closing the repository and removing the test repository path.

**parameters**:
- cls: Represents the class instance.

**Code Description**:
The tearDownClass function is a class method that is responsible for cleaning up the test repository. It first closes the repository using the `close()` method on the `cls.repo` object. Then, it removes the test repository path by executing a system command using `os.system('rm -rf ' + cls.test_repo_path)`.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the `cls.repo` attribute is properly initialized before calling the tearDownClass function to avoid any potential errors. Additionally, exercise caution when using system commands like `os.system('rm -rf')` as they can have significant consequences if not used correctly.
