## ClassDef TestChangeDetector
**TestChangeDetector**: The function of TestChangeDetector is to perform unit tests for the ChangeDetector class methods.

**attributes**: 
· test_repo_path: Path to the test repository.
· repo: Initialized Git repository for testing.

**Code Description**: 
The TestChangeDetector class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the ChangeDetector class methods. 
1. The setUpClass method sets up the test environment by creating a test repository, initializing a Git repository, configuring Git user information, creating test files, and simulating Git operations.
2. The test_get_staged_pys method tests the get_staged_pys method of the ChangeDetector class by creating a new Python file, staging it, and checking if the file is in the staged files list.
3. The test_get_unstaged_mds method tests the get_to_be_staged_files method of the ChangeDetector class by modifying a Markdown file without staging it and checking if the file is in the unstaged files list.
4. The test_add_unstaged_mds method tests the add_unstaged_files method of the ChangeDetector class by ensuring there is an unstaged Markdown file, adding it, and checking if there are no remaining unstaged files after the add operation.
5. The tearDownClass method cleans up the test repository by closing the Git repository and removing the test repository directory.

**Note**: 
- This class is designed for unit testing the ChangeDetector class methods and should be used in conjunction with the ChangeDetector class for testing Git repository operations.
### FunctionDef setUpClass(cls)
**setUpClass**: The function of setUpClass is to set up a test environment by creating a test repository, initializing a Git repository, configuring Git user information, creating test files, and simulating Git operations to add and commit files.

**parameters**:
- cls: Represents the class itself.

**Code Description**:
The setUpClass function first defines the path for the test repository by joining the directory path with 'test_repo'. It then checks if the test repository folder does not exist, it creates the folder. Next, it initializes a Git repository in the test repository path. The function proceeds to configure Git user information by setting the user email and name. After that, it creates two test files, 'test_file.py' containing a Python print statement and 'test_file.md' containing a Markdown heading. Finally, it simulates Git operations by adding all files and making an initial commit.

**Note**:
- This function is typically used in test classes to set up a specific environment before running test cases.

### FunctionDef test_get_staged_pys(self)
**test_get_staged_pys**: The function of test_get_staged_pys is to test the functionality of the get_staged_pys method in the ChangeDetector class.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The test_get_staged_pys function is a unit test that verifies the behavior of the get_staged_pys method in the ChangeDetector class. This method is responsible for retrieving information about Python files that have been added to the staging area in a Git repository.

The function begins by creating a new Python file and staging it in the repository. It uses the os module to generate the path for the new file and opens it in write mode to write a simple print statement. The file is then added to the staging area using the git add command.

Next, an instance of the ChangeDetector class is created, passing the path to the test repository as an argument. This class is responsible for handling file differences and change detection in a Git repository.

The get_staged_pys method is called on the change_detector object to retrieve the added Python files that have been staged. This method utilizes the GitPython library to compare the staging area (index) with the original HEAD commit. It filters out the Python files from the detected changes and determines whether each file is newly created or modified. The method returns a dictionary where the keys are the file paths and the values are booleans indicating whether the file is newly created or not.

The function then asserts that the newly created file is present in the staged_files dictionary. It compares the basename of each file path in the staged_files dictionary with the name of the newly created file.

Finally, the function prints the staged_files dictionary to display the retrieved information about the staged Python files.

**Note**: 
- The get_staged_pys method relies on the GitPython library, so it is important to have this library installed to use the method effectively.
- The function assumes that the repository object (self.repo) is properly initialized before calling the get_staged_pys method.

### FunctionDef test_get_unstaged_mds(self)
**test_get_unstaged_mds**: The function of test_get_unstaged_mds is to test the functionality of retrieving unstaged Markdown files using the ChangeDetector class.

**Code Description**:
The `test_get_unstaged_mds` function is a unit test that verifies the behavior of the `get_to_be_staged_files` method in the `ChangeDetector` class. It ensures that the method correctly retrieves the unstaged Markdown files in the repository.

The function first modifies a Markdown file by appending additional content to it. It then creates an instance of the `ChangeDetector` class, passing the repository path as an argument. The `ChangeDetector` object is responsible for detecting file changes and retrieving unstaged files.

Next, the function calls the `get_to_be_staged_files` method of the `ChangeDetector` object to retrieve the unstaged files. It checks whether the modified Markdown file is present in the list of unstaged files by asserting its presence using the `assertIn` method.

Finally, the function prints the list of unstaged Markdown files for debugging purposes.

**Note**:
- This unit test assumes that the `ChangeDetector` class and its methods, such as `get_to_be_staged_files`, are implemented correctly.
- The `get_to_be_staged_files` method may have some issues and could be improved.
- The function includes debug print statements to aid in troubleshooting.

This function is called by the `test_add_unstaged_mds` method in the `TestChangeDetector` class. The `test_add_unstaged_mds` method ensures that the unstaged Markdown files are correctly added to the staging area using the `add_unstaged_files` method of the `ChangeDetector` class.
***
### FunctionDef test_add_unstaged_mds(self)
**test_add_unstaged_mds**: The function of test_add_unstaged_mds is to test the functionality of adding unstaged Markdown files using the ChangeDetector class.

**Code Description**:
The `test_add_unstaged_mds` function is a unit test that verifies the behavior of the `add_unstaged_files` method in the `ChangeDetector` class. It ensures that the method correctly adds the unstaged Markdown files to the staging area in the repository.

The function first calls the `test_get_unstaged_mds` method to ensure that there is at least one unstaged Markdown file in the repository. This is achieved by modifying a Markdown file without staging it.

Next, the function creates an instance of the `ChangeDetector` class, passing the repository path as an argument. The `ChangeDetector` object is responsible for detecting file changes and adding unstaged files to the staging area.

The function then calls the `add_unstaged_files` method of the `ChangeDetector` object to add the unstaged files to the staging area. It checks whether the list of unstaged files after the add operation is empty by asserting its length using the `assertEqual` method.

Finally, the function prints the number of remaining unstaged Markdown files after the add operation for debugging purposes.

**Note**:
- This unit test assumes that the `ChangeDetector` class and its methods, such as `add_unstaged_files`, are implemented correctly.
- The `add_unstaged_files` method relies on the `get_to_be_staged_files` method to retrieve the list of unstaged files.
- The `get_to_be_staged_files` method may have some issues and could be improved.
- The function includes debug print statements to aid in troubleshooting.
***
### FunctionDef tearDownClass(cls)
**tearDownClass**: The function of tearDownClass is to clean up the test repository by closing the repository and removing the test repository path.

**parameters**:
- cls: Represents the class instance.

**Code Description**:
The tearDownClass function is a class method that is responsible for cleaning up the test repository. It first closes the repository using the `close()` method on the `cls.repo` object. Then, it removes the test repository path by executing the command `os.system('rm -rf ' + cls.test_repo_path)`. This command removes the directory and all its contents recursively.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the `cls.repo` object is properly initialized before calling this method to avoid any potential errors. Additionally, be cautious when using `os.system` as it executes the command in the system's shell, which may pose security risks if not handled properly.
