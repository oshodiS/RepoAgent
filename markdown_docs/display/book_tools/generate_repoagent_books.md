## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to copy Markdown documents from a specified folder to a destination directory, create a README.md file if it does not exist, and set its content to the book name provided as an argument.

**parameters**:
- markdown_docs_folder: The folder containing Markdown documents to be copied.
- book_name: The name of the book to be created.
- repo_path: The path to the repository.

**Code Description**:
The main function first creates a destination directory for the book by joining the book name with the 'src' folder inside the './books' directory. It then sets the source directory for the Markdown documents by joining the repository path with the markdown_docs_folder provided as arguments.

If the destination directory does not exist, it creates the directory and prints a message indicating the creation. It then iterates over the items in the source directory and copies them to the destination directory using shutil.copytree for folders and shutil.copy2 for files. Messages are printed for each copy operation.

A nested function create_book_readme_if_not_exist is defined to create a README.md file inside the destination directory if it does not already exist. The README.md file is opened in write mode, and the book name is written as a header to the file.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the correct arguments are provided when calling the main function to avoid errors.
- The function assumes that the Markdown documents are located in the specified repository path and folder.
### FunctionDef create_book_readme_if_not_exist(dire)
**create_book_readme_if_not_exist**: The function of create_book_readme_if_not_exist is to create a README.md file in the specified directory if it does not already exist.

**parameters**:
- dire: A string representing the directory path where the README.md file should be created.

**Code Description**:
The function first constructs the path to the README.md file by joining the provided directory path with 'README.md'. It then checks if a file already exists at that path using the os.path.exists() function. If the file does not exist, it creates a new README.md file in the specified directory and writes a header containing the book name.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the 'os' module is imported before calling this function as it uses functions from the os module.
- The book_name variable used in the write operation is not defined in the provided code snippet, so make sure to define it before calling this function.
