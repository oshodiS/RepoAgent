## FunctionDef main
**main**: The function of main is to copy Markdown documents from a specified folder to a destination directory, create a README.md file if it does not exist, and organize the copied files accordingly.

**parameters**:
- markdown_docs_folder: The folder containing the Markdown documents to be copied.
- book_name: The name of the book where the documents will be copied.
- repo_path: The path to the repository where the Markdown documents are located.

**Code Description**:
The main function first creates a destination directory for the book by combining the book name with the 'src' folder inside the './books' directory. It then checks if the destination directory exists and creates it if it does not. Next, it iterates over the files in the specified Markdown documents folder and copies them to the destination directory using shutil.copytree for folders and shutil.copy2 for files. During the copying process, it prints the actions taken for each file. After copying all the files, the function checks if a README.md file exists in the destination directory and creates one with the book name as the content if it does not.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the correct command-line arguments are provided when calling this function to specify the Markdown documents folder, book name, and repository path.
- The function assumes a specific directory structure for organizing the copied files and creating the README.md file.
### FunctionDef create_book_readme_if_not_exist(dire)
**create_book_readme_if_not_exist**: The function of create_book_readme_if_not_exist is to create a README.md file in the specified directory if it does not already exist.

**parameters**:
- dire: The directory path where the README.md file should be created.

**Code Description**:
The function first constructs the path to the README.md file by joining the specified directory path with the filename 'README.md'. It then checks if the file already exists in the directory. If the file does not exist, it creates a new README.md file and writes the book name (which is not defined in the provided code snippet) as the content of the file.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the 'book_name' variable is defined and accessible within the scope of the function to correctly write the book name to the README.md file.
- Make sure to handle any potential errors related to file operations, such as file path issues or permission errors.
