## FunctionDef get_config_path
**get_config_path**: The function of get_config_path is to retrieve the path to the configuration file "config.toml" based on the operating system and directory structure.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**:
The get_config_path function first checks the current working directory for the presence of a "config.toml" file. If the file exists, the function returns the path to this file. If the file is not found in the current directory, the function determines the appropriate configuration directory based on the operating system. For Unix and macOS systems, it uses the home directory, while for Windows systems, it uses the APPDATA directory. If the operating system detection fails, a default local directory is used. The function ensures the existence of the configuration directory and the "config.toml" file within it. If the file does not exist, an empty file is created. Finally, the function returns the complete path to the configuration file.

This function is called by other functions in the project, such as read_config and write_config, to obtain the path to the configuration file before reading or writing configuration data.

**Note**:
- This function relies on the operating system to determine the appropriate configuration directory.
- It creates the configuration file if it does not already exist.

**Output Example**:
If the "config.toml" file is found in the current working directory, the function will return: "/path/to/current/directory/config.toml"
## FunctionDef read_config(file_path)
**read_config**: The function of read_config is to read the configuration data from a specified file path or retrieve the path using the get_config_path function if no path is provided.

**parameters**:
- file_path: Optional parameter representing the path to the configuration file. If not provided, the function retrieves the path using get_config_path.

**Code Description**:
The read_config function first checks if a file path is provided. If not, it calls the get_config_path function to obtain the path to the configuration file. It then reads the content of the file using the TOML library and returns the configuration data as a dictionary. If an error occurs during the decoding process, an empty dictionary is returned.

This function is essential for accessing and loading configuration data from the specified file path. It ensures that the configuration file is read correctly and the data is available for further processing within the application.

The read_config function is directly related to the get_config_path function, which provides the path to the configuration file. It is also indirectly connected to other parts of the project that require access to configuration data.

**Note**:
- The function relies on the get_config_path function to determine the path to the configuration file if no path is provided.
- It handles potential decoding errors when reading the configuration file.

**Output Example**:
If the configuration file contains the following data:
```python
{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": 123,
    "key3": ["a", "b", "c"]
}
```
The function will return:
```python
{
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": 123,
    "key3": ["a", "b", "c"]
}
```
## FunctionDef write_config(update_config, file_path)
**write_config**: The function of write_config is to update the configuration file with new settings provided as a dictionary.

**parameters**:
- update_config: A dictionary containing the new configuration settings to be updated.
- file_path: An optional parameter representing the path to the configuration file. If not provided, the function will determine the path based on the operating system.

**Code Description**:
The write_config function first attempts to read the existing configuration file. If the file does not exist, it creates an empty dictionary. It then updates the existing configuration with the new settings provided in the update_config dictionary. Finally, it writes the updated configuration back to the file.

This function interacts with the get_config_path function to determine the file path for the configuration file. It utilizes the tomli library to load and dump TOML formatted data for configuration handling.

**Note**:
- The function automatically creates the configuration file if it does not already exist.
- It is essential to provide the new configuration settings in a dictionary format for successful updating.
