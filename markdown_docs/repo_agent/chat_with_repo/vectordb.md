## ClassDef ChromaManager
**ChromaManager**: The function of ChromaManager is to manage collections in ChromaDB, including initializing a collection and creating a vector store.

**attributes**:
- api_key: The API key used for authentication.
- api_base: The base URL for API requests.
- chroma_collection: The collection managed by ChromaManager.
- is_new_collection: A boolean flag indicating whether the collection is new.

**Code Description**:
The `ChromaManager` class initializes with an API key and base URL. It manages a ChromaDB collection by initializing it with specific parameters. The `init_chroma_collection` method checks for the existence of a collection named "test" and either loads it or creates a new one if it doesn't exist. The `create_vector_store` method processes Markdown content and stores it in the collection, ensuring compatibility with the collection's length.

In the project structure, `ChromaManager` is utilized by the `RepoAssistant` class in `rag.py` to handle ChromaDB operations. The `RepoAssistant` class initializes a `ChromaManager` instance with the provided API key and base URL, integrating it into the overall functionality of the repository agent.

**Note**:
Developers using the `ChromaManager` class should ensure the proper initialization with valid API credentials before utilizing its methods for managing collections and storing vectors.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, api_key, api_base)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ChromaManager object with the provided API key, API base, and default values for the Chroma collection and new collection flag.

**parameters**:
- api_key: The API key used for authentication.
- api_base: The base URL for API requests.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the ChromaManager object by assigning the provided API key and API base to the respective instance variables. It also sets the chroma_collection attribute to None and the is_new_collection flag to False. Additionally, it calls the init_chroma_collection method to ensure the Chroma collection is properly initialized for subsequent operations.

Upon instantiation of a ChromaManager object, this function ensures that the necessary attributes are set up correctly for interacting with the Chroma collection. The init_chroma_collection method is crucial for initializing the collection based on existing data or creating a new one if needed.

**Note**:
- The __init__ function is automatically called when a new ChromaManager object is created.
- It relies on the init_chroma_collection method to handle the initialization of the Chroma collection, ensuring seamless integration with the Chroma database functionality.

### FunctionDef init_chroma_collection(self)
**init_chroma_collection**: The function of init_chroma_collection is to initialize a Chroma collection by either loading an existing collection named "test" or creating a new one if it does not exist.

**parameters**: 
- No external parameters are passed to this function. However, it utilizes the instance variables self.api_key and self.api_base.

**Code Description**:
The init_chroma_collection function begins by creating a PersistentClient object from the chromadb module with a specified path. It then retrieves a list of existing collections using the list_collections method of the chroma_client. The function checks if a collection named "test" is present in the existing collections. If the "test" collection exists, it loads the collection using the get_collection method with specific embedding function parameters. If the collection does not exist, it attempts to create a new collection named "test" with the same embedding function parameters. In case of a UniqueConstraintError during the creation process, indicating that the collection already exists, it then loads the existing "test" collection. Finally, it sets the is_new_collection flag accordingly based on whether a new collection was created.

This function is called automatically upon the initialization of the ChromaManager object, ensuring that the Chroma collection is ready for subsequent operations. Additionally, it is tested in the test_init_chroma_collection method of the TestChromaManager class to verify the correct initialization of the Chroma collection.

**Note**: 
- The init_chroma_collection function relies on the ChromaClient methods to interact with the Chroma database for managing collections.
- It utilizes specific embedding function parameters for creating or loading the "test" collection, ensuring consistency in the embedding process.
- The is_new_collection flag is set to True if a new collection is created, providing insight into the collection's origin.

### FunctionDef create_vector_store(self, md_contents, meta_data)
**create_vector_store**: The function of create_vector_store is to process Markdown content and store it in Chroma, ensuring that the length of ids matches the shorter of md_contents and meta_data.

**parameters**:
- md_contents: A list of Markdown content to be stored.
- meta_data: A list of metadata associated with the Markdown content.

**Code Description**:
The create_vector_store function first checks if it is a new collection. If it is a new collection, it generates ids based on the minimum length of md_contents and meta_data. Then, it adds the documents and metadata to the Chroma collection using the generated ids. If it is not a new collection, it logs a debug message.

This function is called in the main function of the 'main.py' file in the 'chat_with_repo' module. In the main function, after extracting data, the create_vector_store function is invoked on the assistant object, passing the Markdown content and metadata for processing and storage in Chroma.

Additionally, the create_vector_store function is tested in the test_create_vector_store method of the 'test_vectordb.py' file in the 'tests' module. The test verifies that the method correctly calls the embedding function with the Markdown content and adds the documents with corresponding embeddings to the collection.

**Note**:
Ensure that the length of ids matches the shorter of md_contents and meta_data to avoid any mismatch during storage.
