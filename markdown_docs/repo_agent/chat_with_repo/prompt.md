### FunctionDef keyword(self, query)
**keyword**: The function of keyword is to generate a list of code keywords based on a given query.

**parameters**:
- query: A string representing the query for which keywords need to be generated.

**Code Description**:
The `keyword` function takes a query as input, constructs a prompt using the query, and then utilizes the `llm.complete` method to generate a response containing a list of code keywords. The function limits the output to a maximum of three keywords and returns the response.

This function is called within the `respond` method of the `RepoAssistant` class in the `rag.py` file. In the `respond` method, the `keyword` function is used to extract keywords related to a given message and instruction. These keywords are further utilized in the process of querying a collection of documents to retrieve relevant information.

**Note**:
- The `keyword` function relies on an external method `llm.complete` to generate keyword suggestions.
- The output of this function is a list of code keywords based on the provided query.

**Output Example**:
If the query is "test query", the function may return ["keyword1", "keyword2", "keyword3"] as the list of code keywords.
***
### FunctionDef tree(self, query)
**tree**: The function of tree is to generate a tree structure based on the hierarchy of the input text.

**parameters**:
- query: A string representing the text to be analyzed for generating the tree structure.

**Code Description**:
The `tree` function takes a query as input, constructs a prompt with the query, passes it to the `llm.complete` method for analysis, and returns the response which represents the tree structure based on the hierarchy of the input text. This function is a part of the TextAnalysisTool and is used to visualize the hierarchical structure of the provided text.

In the project, this function is called by the test case `test_tree` in the `TestTextAnalysisTool` class. The test case sets up a mock response for the `llm.complete` method, calls the `tree` function with a test query, and asserts that the returned tree structure matches the expected value.

**Note**:
Ensure that the `llm` object has the `complete` method implemented for the `tree` function to work correctly.

**Output Example**:
If the input text is "Header\n  Subheader\n    Subsubheader", the function may return a tree structure like:
- Header
  - Subheader
    - Subsubheader
***
### FunctionDef format_chat_prompt(self, message, instruction)
**format_chat_prompt**: The function of format_chat_prompt is to generate a formatted prompt message for a chat conversation.

**parameters**:
- message: Represents the user's message in the chat.
- instruction: Represents the system's instruction for the user.

**Code Description**: The format_chat_prompt function takes in a user message and a system instruction, then constructs a formatted prompt message that includes the system instruction, user message, and an empty Assistant placeholder. The function returns the formatted prompt message.

In the project, this function is called within the respond method of the RepoAssistant class. The respond method utilizes the format_chat_prompt function to create a prompt for a chat conversation. The generated prompt is then used for further processing, including keyword extraction, query generation, document retrieval, response generation, and more.

**Note**: Ensure that the message and instruction parameters are provided correctly to generate the desired prompt message.

**Output Example**: 
"System: instruction
User: message
Assistant:"

**parameters**:
- message: The text to search for within the JSON file.

**Code Description**:
The queryblock function takes a message as input and utilizes the search_code_contents_by_name method from the JsonFileProcessor class to search for the message within a JSON file. It then retrieves the matching code content and markdown content associated with the message. The function ensures that it always returns both the code content and markdown content lists, even if no matching items are found.

This function is called within the respond method of the RepoAssistant class to search for keywords and retrieve relevant code and markdown content for further processing and response generation.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the message provided matches the 'name' key in the JSON data to retrieve accurate code and markdown content.
