### FunctionDef generate_queries(self, query_str, num_queries)
**generate_queries**: The function of generate_queries is to generate multiple search queries based on a single input query.

**parameters**:
- query_str: A string representing the input query.
- num_queries: An integer specifying the number of search queries to generate (default value is 4).

**Code Description**:
The `generate_queries` function takes an input query string and generates multiple search queries related to the input query. It constructs a prompt template based on the input query and the number of queries to generate. The function then uses a language model to complete the prompt and retrieve the generated queries. Finally, it returns a list of the generated queries.

In the project, this function is called within the `respond` method of the `RepoAssistant` class. After processing the input message and instruction, the `respond` method utilizes the `generate_queries` function to generate search queries based on the input prompt. These generated queries are then used to retrieve relevant documents and codes for further processing and response generation.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the input query string is provided for the function to generate queries.
- The number of queries to generate can be customized by providing the `num_queries` parameter.

**Output Example**:
If the function is called with `generate_queries("example query", 3)`, it may return:
["Generated Query 1", "Generated Query 2", "Generated Query 3"]
***
### FunctionDef rerank(self, query, docs)
**rerank**: The function of rerank is to reorder a list of documents based on their relevance scores and return the top 5 most relevant documents.

**parameters**:
- query: The query used to retrieve relevant documents.
- docs: A list of documents to be ranked based on relevance scores.

**Code Description**:
The rerank function takes a query and a list of documents as input. It then sends a request to a language model to rank the documents based on their relevance scores. The function extracts the relevance scores from the response, sorts the documents in descending order of relevance scores, and returns the content of the top 5 most relevant documents.

In the project, the rerank function is called within the respond function of the RepoAssistant class. After retrieving a list of unique documents, the respond function calls rerank to reorder the documents based on relevance scores. The reranked documents are then further processed to generate a response message.

**Note**: 
- The rerank function relies on an external language model to calculate relevance scores.

***
### FunctionDef respond(self, message, instruction)
**respond**: The function of respond is to generate a response message based on the user's message and instruction.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
- message: Represents the user's message in the chat.
- instruction: Indicates the system's instruction or message to the user.

**Code Description**:
The `respond` function takes in the user's message and system instruction as parameters. It first formats the chat prompt by calling the `format_chat_prompt` function from the `TextAnalysisTool` module, which generates a formatted prompt message incorporating the user's message and system instruction. The formatted prompt is then used to extract keywords by calling the `keyword` function from the same module. These keywords are further utilized to generate search queries by calling the `generate_queries` function. The function then retrieves relevant documents and metadata based on the generated queries using the `chroma_collection.query` method. The retrieved documents are processed to obtain unique document IDs and their corresponding code content. The function then reranks the retrieved documents based on their relevance scores by calling the `rerank` function. The reranked documents are used as input to the `rag` function, which generates a response by combining the user's query with relevant information from the documents. The function also utilizes the `nerquery` function to extract keywords from the bot message and prompt questions. The extracted keywords are used to query blocks of code by calling the `queryblock` function. The results are further processed and combined to generate a response message. Finally, the function utilizes the `list_to_markdown` function to convert lists of items into markdown format.

In the project, the `respond` function is called within the `main` function in the `main.py` file. The `main` function initializes the `RepoAssistant` object and sets up the necessary configurations. It then calls the `respond` function to generate a response based on the user's input. The `respond` function plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between the user and the chatbot assistant within the repository system.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `message` and `instruction` parameters are provided correctly to generate an accurate response.
- The function relies on various other functions and modules to perform its tasks, so ensure that all dependencies are properly set up and accessible.

**Output Example**:
If the function is called with a user message "How to install Python?" and an instruction "Please provide installation steps", the return value might be:
("How to install Python?", "Response message", "Markdown formatted chunk recall", "List of extracted questions", "List of unique code snippets", "Markdown formatted code blocks")
