## FunctionDef main
**main**: The main function serves as the entry point for the chat_with_repo module. It initializes the necessary variables and objects, such as the API key, base URL, and database path, by loading the configuration from a file. It then creates an instance of the RepoAssistant class, passing in the API key, base URL, and database path. Finally, it initializes the GradioInterface class, passing in the respond function from the RepoAssistant instance.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The main function starts by loading the configuration from a file, which contains the API key, base URL, and database path. It then creates an instance of the RepoAssistant class, which is responsible for assisting in repository question and answer tasks. The RepoAssistant instance is initialized with the API key, base URL, and database path.

Next, the main function creates an instance of the GradioInterface class, which is responsible for creating a user interface for interacting with the chatbot system. The GradioInterface instance is initialized with the respond function from the RepoAssistant instance.

The main function acts as the central point for initializing and connecting the various components of the chat_with_repo module. It ensures that the necessary objects are created and configured correctly to enable smooth communication between the user and the chatbot system.

**Note**:
- Developers can modify the configuration file to customize the API key, base URL, and database path according to their requirements.
- The main function is typically executed when running the chat_with_repo module as a standalone application or when integrating it into a larger project.
- Ensure that the configuration file is present and contains the required information for proper initialization of the RepoAssistant and GradioInterface classes.

**Output Example**:
The main function does not return any output. It is responsible for setting up the necessary objects and components for the chat_with_repo module to function properly.

Raw code:
```python
def main():
    # Load configuration from file
    config = load_config()

    # Initialize RepoAssistant with API key, base URL, and database path
    assistant = RepoAssistant(
        api_key=config['api_key'],
        api_base=config['api_base'],
        db_path=config['db_path']
    )

    # Initialize GradioInterface with the respond function from RepoAssistant
    GradioInterface(assistant.respond)
```

**Note**: The actual behavior of the main function may vary depending on the specific implementation and usage requirements of the chat_with_repo module.
