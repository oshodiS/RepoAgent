## ClassDef JsonFileProcessor
**JsonFileProcessor**: The function of JsonFileProcessor is to process JSON files, extract specific data, and search for code contents based on given criteria.

**attributes**:
- file_path: The path to the JSON file.

**Code Description**:
The `JsonFileProcessor` class provides methods to read JSON files, extract data based on specific criteria, and search for code contents within the JSON data. The `read_json_file` method reads the JSON file specified by the `file_path` attribute and returns the data. The `extract_data` method extracts relevant information from the JSON data based on predefined rules. The `recursive_search` method recursively searches for code contents by name within the JSON data. The `search_code_contents_by_name` method initiates the search process based on the provided search text.

When the `extract_data` method is called, it reads the JSON file, iterates through the data, and extracts relevant information into a structured format. The `recursive_search` method is used internally to search for code contents within the JSON data recursively. The `search_code_contents_by_name` method utilizes the `recursive_search` method to find and return code contents and corresponding markdown contents based on the provided search text.

The `JsonFileProcessor` class is designed to handle JSON file processing tasks efficiently, enabling users to extract specific data and search for code contents within JSON data seamlessly.

**Note**:
- Ensure the JSON file exists at the specified `file_path` before calling the methods.
- Handle exceptions such as `FileNotFoundError` and `JSONDecodeError` appropriately when working with JSON files.

**Output Example**:
```python
code_results = ["Code content1", "Code content2"]
md_results = ["Markdown content1", "Markdown content2"]
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, file_path)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object with a file path.

**parameters**:
- file_path: A string representing the path to the file.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function takes in a file_path parameter and assigns it to the object's file_path attribute. This allows the object to be initialized with a specific file path, which can be used for file operations or processing within the object.

**Note**:
It is important to provide a valid file path when initializing an object of this class to ensure proper functionality.

### FunctionDef read_json_file(self)
**read_json_file**: The function of read_json_file is to read JSON data from a file specified by the file_path attribute of the object.

**parameters**:
- self: The object itself containing the file_path attribute.

**Code Description**: 
The read_json_file function attempts to open and read a JSON file specified by the file_path attribute. If the file is found, it loads the JSON data and returns it. If the file is not found, it logs an exception using the logger and exits the program with an error code of 1.

This function is called by the extract_data method in the JsonFileProcessor class. In the extract_data method, read_json_file is used to load JSON data from a file, iterate through the data, extract specific information, and build dictionaries based on the extracted content.

The test_read_json_file method in the TestJsonFileProcessor class also calls read_json_file to test if the function correctly reads the JSON file and returns the expected data.

**Note**: 
Developers using this function should ensure that the file_path attribute is correctly set before calling read_json_file to avoid FileNotFoundError exceptions.

**Output Example**: 
If the JSON file contains data like {"files": [{"objects": [{"md_content": "content1"}]}]}, read_json_file will return {"files": [{"objects": [{"md_content": "content1"}]}]}.

### FunctionDef extract_data(self)
**extract_data**: The function of extract_data is to load JSON data from a file, iterate through the data, extract specific information, and build dictionaries based on the extracted content.

**parameters**:
- self: The object itself.

**Code Description**: 
The extract_data function reads JSON data from a file using the read_json_file method. It iterates through each file in the JSON data, extracts relevant information, and constructs dictionaries based on the extracted content. The function checks for specific fields in the JSON data, such as 'md_content', and builds a dictionary with key information like type, name, code start and end lines, presence of return, code content, name column, and item status. The extracted data is stored in the 'extracted_contents' list along with the first element of 'md_content' stored in the 'md_contents' list. 

This function is called within the main method of the project, where it is used to extract data from JSON files and prepare the necessary information for further processing. The extracted data is then passed to the 'create_vector_store' method in the 'chroma_data' object for additional processing.

**Note**: Developers should ensure that the JSON data structure aligns with the expected format to extract the required information correctly.

**Output Example**: 
If the JSON file contains data like {"files": [{"objects": [{"md_content": "content1"}]}]}, the function will return two lists: 
- md_contents: ["content1"]
- extracted_contents: [{"type": "UnknownType", "name": "Unnamed", "code_start_line": -1, "code_end_line": -1, "have_return": False, "code_content": "NoContent", "name_column": 0, "item_status": "UnknownStatus"}]

### FunctionDef recursive_search(self, data_item, search_text, code_results, md_results)
**recursive_search**: The function of recursive_search is to search for a specific text within nested dictionaries and lists, extracting relevant data based on the search criteria.

**parameters**:
- data_item: The dictionary or list to search through recursively.
- search_text: The text to search for within the data.
- code_results: A list to store the code content of matching items.
- md_results: A list to store the markdown content of matching items.

**Code Description**:
The recursive_search function is designed to traverse through nested dictionaries and lists to find items that match a specific search text. It iterates over the elements of the data_item, checking for matches based on the search_text. If a match is found in a dictionary item's 'name' key, the corresponding 'code_content' and 'md_content' are appended to the code_results and md_results lists, respectively. The function handles nested dictionaries and lists by making recursive calls to itself, ensuring thorough search coverage.

In the context of the project, the recursive_search function is called within the search_code_contents_by_name method of the JsonFileProcessor class. This method attempts to retrieve code from a JSON file, then utilizes recursive_search to find and extract code and markdown content that matches a specified search text. The code_results and md_results lists are populated with the relevant content, which is then returned to the caller for further processing or display.

**Note**:
It is essential to provide the correct data_item, search_text, code_results, and md_results parameters when calling the recursive_search function to ensure accurate search results. Additionally, handle exceptions such as FileNotFoundError, JSONDecodeError, and general exceptions appropriately to maintain code robustness and error handling capabilities.

### FunctionDef search_code_contents_by_name(self, file_path, search_text)
**search_code_contents_by_name**: The function of search_code_contents_by_name is to search for specific text within a JSON file and retrieve matching code and markdown content.

**parameters**:
- file_path: The path to the JSON file to search.
- search_text: The text to search for within the JSON file.

**Code Description**:
The search_code_contents_by_name function attempts to read a JSON file specified by file_path. It then searches for occurrences of search_text within the JSON data. If matches are found, the function extracts the corresponding code content and markdown content and returns them as lists. In case of no matches or errors, appropriate messages are returned. This function relies on the recursive_search method to navigate through nested data structures within the JSON file.

This function is called within the TextAnalysisTool class in the queryblock method. The queryblock method utilizes search_code_contents_by_name to search for specific text within the JSON file path provided and returns the search results for further processing.

**Note**:
Ensure to provide the correct file_path and search_text parameters when calling this function. Handle exceptions such as FileNotFoundError, JSONDecodeError, and general exceptions to manage potential errors effectively.

**Output Example**:
If matching items are found:
(["code_content1", "code_content2"], ["md_content1", "md_content2"])

If no matching items are found:
(["No matching item found."], ["No matching item found."])
