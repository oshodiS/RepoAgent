## ClassDef JsonFileProcessor
**JsonFileProcessor**: The function of JsonFileProcessor is to process JSON files, extract specific data, and search for content within the JSON structure.

**attributes**:
- file_path: The path to the JSON file.

**Code Description**:
The `JsonFileProcessor` class provides methods to read JSON files, extract data based on specific criteria, and search for content within the JSON structure. 
- The `read_json_file` method reads the JSON file specified by `file_path` attribute and returns the data.
- The `extract_data` method extracts relevant information from the JSON data based on predefined criteria.
- The `recursive_search` method recursively searches for content within the JSON data structure.
- The `search_code_contents_by_name` method searches for code content based on a specified search text within the JSON data.

When called by other objects in the project:
- In the `TextAnalysisTool` class in `prompt.py`, the `JsonFileProcessor` is initialized with a database path.
- In the `RepoAssistant` class in `rag.py`, the `JsonFileProcessor` is used to load JSON data from the specified database path.

**Note**: Ensure the JSON file exists and is valid before using the methods of this class.

**Output Example**:
```python
# Example output of extract_data method
md_contents = ["content1", "content2"]
extracted_contents = [
    {
        "type": "Type1",
        "name": "Name1",
        "code_start_line": 10,
        "code_end_line": 20,
        "have_return": True,
        "code_content": "Code snippet 1",
        "name_column": 1,
        "item_status": "Status1"
    },
    {
        "type": "Type2",
        "name": "Name2",
        "code_start_line": 5,
        "code_end_line": 15,
        "have_return": False,
        "code_content": "Code snippet 2",
        "name_column": 2,
        "item_status": "Status2"
    }
]
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, file_path)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object with the provided file_path.

**parameters**:
- file_path: A string representing the path to the file that will be processed.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a constructor method that is called when a new instance of the JsonFileProcessor class is created. It takes the file_path parameter and assigns it to the object's file_path attribute.

**Note**:
- This function is essential for setting up the initial state of the JsonFileProcessor object with the specified file_path.
***
### FunctionDef read_json_file(self)
**read_json_file**: The function of read_json_file is to read and load JSON data from a specified file path.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**: The read_json_file function attempts to open a JSON file located at the specified file path. If the file is found, it reads the file using UTF-8 encoding and loads the data using the json.load() method. The loaded data is then returned. If the file is not found, an exception is caught, and a log message is generated using the logger module before exiting the program with a status code of 1.

This function is an essential part of the JsonFileProcessor class, responsible for reading JSON data from a file. It is called within the extract_data method of the same class to extract specific contents from the loaded JSON data.

**Note**: It is crucial to ensure that the file path provided is correct to avoid FileNotFoundError exceptions.

**Output Example**: 
```python
{
    "files": [
        {
            "objects": [
                {
                    "md_content": "content1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
***
### FunctionDef extract_data(self)
**extract_data**: The function of extract_data is to extract specific content from JSON data loaded from a file.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.

**Code Description**: The extract_data function reads JSON data from a file using the read_json_file method. It iterates through the data, extracts relevant information based on predefined criteria, and builds a dictionary for each item meeting the criteria. The function returns two lists: one containing the first element of 'md_content' from each item and another containing dictionaries with extracted information for qualifying items.

This function is a crucial part of the JsonFileProcessor class, responsible for processing JSON data and extracting structured content. It is utilized within the project to extract specific details from JSON files for further processing.

**Note**: Ensure that the JSON data structure aligns with the expected format to extract the necessary information accurately.

**Output Example**: 
```python
md_contents = ["content1", "content2"]
extracted_contents = [
    {
        "type": "Type1",
        "name": "Item1",
        "code_start_line": 10,
        "code_end_line": 20,
        "have_return": True,
        "code_content": "Sample code content",
        "name_column": 1,
        "item_status": "Status1"
    },
    {
        "type": "Type2",
        "name": "Item2",
        "code_start_line": 5,
        "code_end_line": 15,
        "have_return": False,
        "code_content": "Another code content",
        "name_column": 0,
        "item_status": "Status2"
    }
]
```
***
### FunctionDef recursive_search(self, data_item, search_text, code_results, md_results)
**recursive_search**: The function of recursive_search is to search for a specific text within nested dictionaries and lists, extracting relevant data based on the search criteria.

**parameters**:
- data_item: The current data item being analyzed, which can be a dictionary or a list.
- search_text: The text to search for within the data.
- code_results: A list to store the code content of matching items.
- md_results: A list to store the markdown content of matching items.

**Code Description**:
The recursive_search function is designed to traverse through nested dictionaries and lists recursively to find items that match the search_text. It first checks if the data_item is a dictionary, then iterates through its key-value pairs. If the value is another dictionary or list, the function calls itself recursively. If the data_item is a list, it iterates through each item, checking for a 'name' key that matches the search_text. If a match is found, the 'code_content' and 'md_content' of the item are appended to the code_results and md_results lists, respectively. The function continues to search recursively in case of nested lists or dictionaries.

This function is called by the search_code_contents_by_name method in the JsonFileProcessor class. The search_code_contents_by_name method attempts to retrieve code from a JSON file, then initializes code_results and md_results lists before calling recursive_search to populate these lists with matching items. The method ensures that even if no matching items are found, it returns specific messages to indicate the absence of results or any encountered errors.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the search_text provided aligns with the data structure being searched to obtain accurate results.
- Handle exceptions such as FileNotFound and JSONDecodeError to maintain the robustness of the search functionality.
***
### FunctionDef search_code_contents_by_name(self, file_path, search_text)
**search_code_contents_by_name**: The function of search_code_contents_by_name is to search for specific text within a JSON file and retrieve relevant code content and markdown content based on the search criteria.

**parameters**:
- file_path: The path to the JSON file to be searched.
- search_text: The text to search for within the JSON file.

**Code Description**:
The search_code_contents_by_name function attempts to read a JSON file specified by file_path. It then searches for items within the JSON data that match the search_text. The function utilizes a recursive approach by calling the recursive_search method to traverse through nested dictionaries and lists within the JSON data. Matching items' code content and markdown content are stored in code_results and md_results lists respectively. The function handles exceptions such as FileNotFoundError, JSONDecodeError, and other general exceptions to ensure robust error handling.

This function is called by the queryblock method in the TextAnalysisTool class in the prompt.py file. The queryblock method invokes search_code_contents_by_name to search for specific text within the JSON file path provided. The search results are then returned by the queryblock method.

**Note**:
- Ensure the search_text aligns with the structure of the JSON data for accurate search results.
- Handle exceptions appropriately to maintain the functionality and reliability of the search process.

**Output Example**:
If matching items are found:
```python
(["Matching code content 1", "Matching code content 2"], ["Matching markdown content 1", "Matching markdown content 2"])
```
If no matching items are found:
```python
(["No matching item found."], ["No matching item found."])
```
