## ClassDef JsonFileProcessor
**JsonFileProcessor**: The function of JsonFileProcessor is to process JSON files, extract specific data, and search for code contents based on given criteria.

**attributes**:
- file_path: The path to the JSON file.

**Code Description**:
The `JsonFileProcessor` class provides methods to read JSON files, extract data, and search for code contents. 
- The `read_json_file` method reads the JSON file specified by `file_path` and returns the data.
- The `extract_data` method extracts specific information from the JSON file based on predefined criteria.
- The `recursive_search` method recursively searches for code contents in the JSON data.
- The `search_code_contents_by_name` method searches for code contents by a specific name in the JSON file.

When the `JsonFileProcessor` class is instantiated, the `file_path` parameter is provided. The class methods can then be used to interact with the JSON data.

This class is utilized in other parts of the project, such as in the `TextAnalysisTool` class in `prompt.py`, where it is used to process JSON data for text analysis.

**Note**: Ensure the JSON file exists and has valid JSON format before using the methods of this class.

**Output Example**:
```python
["content1"], [{"type": "UnknownType", "name": "Unnamed", "code_start_line": -1, "code_end_line": -1, "have_return": False, "code_content": "NoContent", "name_column": 0, "item_status": "UnknownStatus"}]
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, file_path)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object with the provided file_path parameter.

**parameters**:
- file_path: A string representing the path to the file that will be processed.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a constructor method that is called when a new instance of the JsonFileProcessor class is created. It takes in a file_path parameter and assigns it to the object's file_path attribute for further processing.

**Note**:
Make sure to provide a valid file path when initializing an instance of the JsonFileProcessor class to ensure proper functionality.

### FunctionDef read_json_file(self)
**read_json_file**: The function of read_json_file is to read and load JSON data from a specified file path.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The read_json_file function attempts to open a JSON file specified by the file_path attribute of the current instance. It reads the file, loads the JSON data, and returns the loaded data. If the file is not found, an exception is caught, an error message is logged, and the program exits with a status code of 1.

This function is an essential part of the JsonFileProcessor class in handling JSON files. It ensures that the JSON data is correctly read and processed for further operations within the class.

The read_json_file function is called by the extract_data method within the same class. In the extract_data method, the JSON data is extracted and processed further based on specific criteria, such as checking for specific fields and building dictionaries with required information.

The read_json_file function is also tested in the test_read_json_file method in the test_json_handler.py file. This test method verifies that the function correctly reads the JSON file and returns the expected data.

**Note**:
Developers using this function should ensure that the file_path attribute is correctly set before calling the read_json_file method to avoid FileNotFoundError exceptions.

**Output Example**:
```python
{
    "files": [
        {
            "objects": [
                {
                    "md_content": "content1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### FunctionDef extract_data(self)
**extract_data**: The function of extract_data is to extract specific data from JSON files based on predefined criteria and return the extracted content in a structured format.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The extract_data function first reads JSON data from a file using the read_json_file method. It then iterates through the JSON data, extracts relevant information, and builds dictionaries with required fields. The extracted data includes details such as type, name, code start and end lines, content, and status of each item. The function filters out items that do not meet the specified criteria and returns two lists: one containing the first element of 'md_content' from valid items, and another containing dictionaries with extracted information.

This function is a crucial part of the JsonFileProcessor class within the chat_with_repo module. It is called by the main function in the main.py file to process JSON data and prepare it for further operations. The extracted data is then used to create a vector store in the project.

The extract_data function ensures that only relevant data is extracted and structured appropriately for downstream processes. It plays a significant role in handling and organizing JSON data within the project hierarchy.

**Note**:
Developers utilizing the extract_data function should ensure that the JSON data follows the expected structure to extract the necessary information correctly. Any deviations in the JSON format might impact the extraction process and the quality of the extracted content.

**Output Example**:
```python
md_contents = ["content1", "content2"]
extracted_contents = [
    {
        "type": "Type1",
        "name": "Item1",
        "code_start_line": 10,
        "code_end_line": 20,
        "have_return": True,
        "code_content": "Sample code content",
        "name_column": 1,
        "item_status": "Status1"
    },
    {
        "type": "Type2",
        "name": "Item2",
        "code_start_line": 5,
        "code_end_line": 15,
        "have_return": False,
        "code_content": "Another code snippet",
        "name_column": 0,
        "item_status": "Status2"
    }
]
```

### FunctionDef recursive_search(self, data_item, search_text, code_results, md_results)
**recursive_search**: The function of recursive_search is to search for a specific text within nested dictionaries and lists, extracting corresponding code and markdown content.

**parameters**:
- data_item: The dictionary or list to search through recursively.
- search_text: The text to search for within the data.
- code_results: A list to store matching items' code content.
- md_results: A list to store matching items' markdown content.

**Code Description**:
The recursive_search function iterates through the provided data_item, searching for the search_text within dictionaries and lists. If the search_text is found in a dictionary item's 'name' key, the corresponding 'code_content' and 'md_content' are appended to the code_results and md_results lists, respectively. The function handles nested dictionaries and lists by recursively calling itself on each nested item.

This function is called by the search_code_contents_by_name method in the JsonFileProcessor class. The search_code_contents_by_name method attempts to retrieve code from a JSON file, then invokes recursive_search to find and collect code and markdown content matching a specified search_text. If no matching items are found, default messages are returned. Various exceptions such as FileNotFoundError, JSONDecodeError, and general exceptions are caught and appropriate error messages are returned.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the data_item provided is a dictionary or a list for the function to work correctly.
- The search_text should match the 'name' key in dictionary items to retrieve code and markdown content accurately.

### FunctionDef search_code_contents_by_name(self, file_path, search_text)
**search_code_contents_by_name**: The function of search_code_contents_by_name is to search for specific text within a JSON file, extract corresponding code and markdown content, and handle various exceptions during the process.

**parameters**:
- file_path: The path to the JSON file to be searched.
- search_text: The text to search for within the JSON file.

**Code Description**:
The search_code_contents_by_name function attempts to retrieve code from the JSON file specified by file_path. It then searches for the search_text within the JSON data using the recursive_search method. If matching items are found, their code content and markdown content are stored in code_results and md_results lists, respectively. The function ensures that it always returns both code_results and md_results lists, even if no matching items are found. It handles exceptions such as FileNotFoundError, JSONDecodeError, and other general exceptions by providing appropriate error messages.

This function is closely related to the recursive_search method in the JsonFileProcessor class, which is responsible for recursively searching through nested dictionaries and lists to find the desired text and extract corresponding code and markdown content.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the file_path provided leads to a valid JSON file.
- The search_text should match the 'name' key in the JSON data to retrieve accurate code and markdown content.

**Output Example**:
If matching items are found:
([matching_code1, matching_code2], [matching_md1, matching_md2])

If no matching items are found:
(["No matching item found."], ["No matching item found."])
