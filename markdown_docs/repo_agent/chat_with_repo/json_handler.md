## ClassDef JsonFileProcessor
**JsonFileProcessor**: The function of JsonFileProcessor is to process JSON files, extract specific data, and search for code contents based on given criteria.

**attributes**:
- file_path: The path to the JSON file to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The `JsonFileProcessor` class provides methods to read JSON files, extract data based on specific criteria, and search for code contents within the JSON structure. 
- The `read_json_file` method reads the JSON file specified by the `file_path` attribute and returns the data.
- The `extract_data` method extracts relevant information from the JSON data, such as type, name, code content, and status.
- The `recursive_search` method recursively searches for code contents based on a given search text within the JSON data.
- The `search_code_contents_by_name` method searches for code contents by name within the JSON data.

When called by other objects in the project:
- In the `TextAnalysisTool` class within `prompt.py`, the `JsonFileProcessor` is initialized with a database path to facilitate text analysis tasks.
- In the `RepoAssistant` class within `rag.py`, the `JsonFileProcessor` is used to load JSON data for the repository assistant.
- In the test cases within `test_json_handler.py`, the `JsonFileProcessor` is instantiated for testing purposes and its methods are tested for functionality.

**Note**:
Ensure that the `file_path` provided to the `JsonFileProcessor` constructor is a valid path to a JSON file.

**Output Example**:
```python
(["content1"], [{"type": "UnknownType", "name": "Unnamed", "code_start_line": -1, "code_end_line": -1, "have_return": False, "code_content": "NoContent", "name_column": 0, "item_status": "UnknownStatus"}])
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, file_path)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object with the provided file path.

**parameters**:
- file_path: A string representing the path to the file that the object will operate on.

**Code Description**:
In this function, the constructor method __init__ takes in a file_path parameter and assigns it to the object's file_path attribute. This allows the object to be instantiated with a specific file path, which can be used for file operations or processing within the object.

**Note**:
It is important to provide a valid file path as an argument when instantiating an object of this class to ensure proper functionality.

### FunctionDef read_json_file(self)
**read_json_file**: The function of read_json_file is to read and load JSON data from a specified file path.

**parameters**: 
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**: 
The read_json_file function attempts to open a file specified by self.file_path, reads the JSON data from the file, and returns the loaded data. If the file is not found, an exception is caught, and a log message is generated before exiting the program.

This function is crucial for extracting data from JSON files within the JsonFileProcessor class. It ensures that the necessary data is read correctly and made available for further processing.

**Note**: 
Developers using this function should ensure that the file path provided is correct to avoid FileNotFoundError exceptions. Additionally, handling the returned JSON data appropriately based on the file's content structure is essential for downstream operations.

**Output Example**: 
```python
{
    "files": [
        {
            "objects": [
                {
                    "md_content": "content1"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### FunctionDef extract_data(self)
**extract_data**: The function of extract_data is to extract specific data from JSON files based on predefined criteria and return the extracted content in a structured format.
**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The extract_data function first reads JSON data from a file using the read_json_file function. It then iterates through each file in the JSON data, extracts relevant information based on certain conditions, and builds a dictionary for each item meeting the criteria. The extracted data includes type, name, code start and end lines, return status, code content, name column, and item status. Finally, it returns two lists: md_contents containing the first element of 'md_content' from each item, and extracted_contents containing dictionaries with the extracted information.

This function is essential for processing JSON data within the JsonFileProcessor class, enabling the extraction of specific content for further analysis or manipulation.

**Note**:
Developers using this function should ensure that the JSON data structure aligns with the expected format to extract the required information accurately. Understanding the fields and their significance in the extracted dictionary is crucial for utilizing the extracted data effectively in downstream processes.

**Output Example**:
```python
(
    ["content1", "content2"],
    [
        {
            "type": "Function",
            "name": "example_function",
            "code_start_line": 10,
            "code_end_line": 20,
            "have_return": True,
            "code_content": "def example_function():\n    return True",
            "name_column": 0,
            "item_status": "Active"
        },
        {
            "type": "Variable",
            "name": "example_variable",
            "code_start_line": 5,
            "code_end_line": 5,
            "have_return": False,
            "code_content": "example_variable = 10",
            "name_column": 1,
            "item_status": "Inactive"
        }
    ]
)
```

### FunctionDef recursive_search(self, data_item, search_text, code_results, md_results)
**recursive_search**: The function of recursive_search is to search for a specific text within nested dictionaries and lists, extracting relevant data based on the search criteria.

**parameters**:
- data_item: The current data item being processed, which can be a dictionary or a list.
- search_text: The text to search for within the data structure.
- code_results: A list to store the code content of matching items.
- md_results: A list to store the markdown content of matching items.

**Code Description**:
The recursive_search function is designed to traverse through nested dictionaries and lists recursively to find items that match the search_text. It first checks if the data_item is a dictionary, and if so, iterates through its key-value pairs. If the value is another dictionary or a list, the function calls itself recursively to continue the search. If the data_item is a list, it iterates through each item, checking for a 'name' key that matches the search_text. If a match is found, the 'code_content' and 'md_content' of the item are appended to the respective result lists. The function handles nested structures by making recursive calls to search deeper levels.

In the context of the project, the recursive_search function is called by the search_code_contents_by_name method in the JsonFileProcessor class. This method attempts to retrieve code from a JSON file, then initiates the recursive search process by calling recursive_search with the loaded data, search_text, and empty result lists. The search results are then returned, ensuring that both code_results and md_results are populated with relevant content or default messages if no match is found.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the search_text provided aligns with the structure of the data being searched to retrieve accurate results.
- Handle exceptions such as FileNotFound, JSONDecodeError, and other unexpected errors gracefully within the calling method for robust error handling.
***
### FunctionDef search_code_contents_by_name(self, file_path, search_text)
**search_code_contents_by_name**: The function of search_code_contents_by_name is to search for specific text within a JSON file loaded data structure and extract relevant code content and markdown content based on the search criteria.

**parameters**:
- file_path: The path to the JSON file to be searched.
- search_text: The text to search for within the JSON data structure.

**Code Description**:
The search_code_contents_by_name function attempts to retrieve code from the specified JSON file and then initiates a recursive search process by calling the recursive_search function. It handles exceptions such as FileNotFound, Invalid JSON file, and other unexpected errors gracefully. The function returns code_results and md_results containing matching items' code content and markdown content, or default messages if no match is found.

This function is called by the queryblock method in the TextAnalysisTool class in the prompt.py file. The queryblock method utilizes the search_code_contents_by_name function to search for specific text within the JSON file based on the provided message.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the search_text aligns with the structure of the JSON data for accurate search results.
- Handle exceptions appropriately for robust error handling.

**Output Example**:
```python
(["Matching code content 1", "Matching code content 2"], ["Matching markdown content 1", "Matching markdown content 2"])
```
