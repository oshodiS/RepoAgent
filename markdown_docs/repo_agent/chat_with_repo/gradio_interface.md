## ClassDef GradioInterface
**GradioInterface**: The function of GradioInterface is to create a user interface for interacting with a chatbot system.

**attributes**:
- respond: A function that handles responses from the chatbot.
- cssa: CSS styling for the interface.
- cssb: Closing HTML tags for the styling.
- setup_gradio_interface(): Method to set up the Gradio interface.
- wrapper_respond(): Method to format and display responses, embedding recall, and code snippets.
- clean(): Method to clean the interface elements.

**Code Description**:
The GradioInterface class initializes with a respond function and CSS styling for the interface. It contains methods to format and display responses, embedding recall, and code snippets. The setup_gradio_interface method sets up the Gradio interface with input fields and buttons for user interaction. The wrapper_respond method formats the chatbot responses using HTML and CSS styling. The clean method clears the interface elements for a new interaction.

This class is called in the main function of the project to create a Gradio interface for interacting with a chatbot system. The Gradio interface allows users to input questions, receive responses, view embedding recall, and see code snippets generated by the chatbot.

**Note**: Developers can customize the CSS styling and functionality of the Gradio interface to suit their specific chatbot system requirements.

**Output Example**:
A user interface displaying chatbot responses, embedding recall, and code snippets in a visually appealing format.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, respond_function)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the GradioInterface object with the provided respond_function and CSS styling templates.

**parameters**:
- respond_function: The function that handles responses in the Gradio interface.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function sets the respond_function and CSS styling templates for the GradioInterface object. It initializes the CSS styling for the Gradio interface, defining the outer and inner box styles along with content formatting. The setup_gradio_interface function is then called to create the Gradio interface for user interaction with the chat system.

The CSS styling templates define the visual appearance of the interface, including borders, padding, font sizes, and scroll behavior. The respond_function is assigned to handle user inputs and generate formatted responses on the interface.

The setup_gradio_interface function is crucial for creating a user-friendly interface that allows users to input questions, view responses, embedding recall, and code outputs. It leverages HTML and CSS to structure the interface elements and links user inputs to the respond_function for processing.

**Note**:
- The __init__ function is essential for initializing the GradioInterface object with the necessary components for creating the chat interface.
- The CSS styling templates define the visual presentation of the Gradio interface, enhancing user experience and readability.
- The respond_function plays a key role in processing user inputs and generating appropriate responses on the interface.

### FunctionDef wrapper_respond(self, msg_input, system_input)
**wrapper_respond**: The function of wrapper_respond is to format the outputs of the respond function with markdown and CSS styling.

**parameters**:
- msg_input: Input message for the respond function.
- system_input: System input for the respond function.

**Code Description**:
The wrapper_respond function takes two inputs, msg_input and system_input, and then calls the respond function with these inputs. It formats the outputs of the respond function using markdown and CSS styling. The output1, output2, and code are formatted with markdown, and then additional CSS styling is applied to create a visually appealing response, embedding recall, and code display. Finally, the function returns the formatted message and outputs.

This function is called within the setup_gradio_interface function in the GradioInterface class. In the setup_gradio_interface function, wrapper_respond is linked to the submit button click event to handle user inputs and display the formatted outputs in the Gradio interface. Additionally, the clean function is linked to the clear button click event to reset the input fields and outputs.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the inputs msg_input and system_input are provided correctly to receive the formatted outputs.
- The function relies on the respond function for generating the initial outputs before formatting.

**Output Example**:
```python
msg = "How are you?"
system_input = "Please provide feedback."
msg_output, formatted_output1, formatted_output2, output3, formatted_code, codex = wrapper_respond(msg, system_input)

# Example formatted output
print(formatted_output1)
print(formatted_output2)
print(formatted_code)
```

### FunctionDef clean(self)
**clean**: The function of clean is to generate HTML outputs for different sections.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `clean` function in the `GradioInterface` class generates HTML outputs for different sections such as "Response", "Embedding Recall", and "Code". It constructs HTML content using predefined CSS styles and returns these outputs along with an empty message and code snippet.

This function is called within the `setup_gradio_interface` function of the `GradioInterface` class in the `gradio_interface.py` file. In the `setup_gradio_interface` function, the `clean` function is linked to a ClearButton element, allowing users to clear the input fields and reset the outputs displayed on the interface.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize the `clean` function to reset the displayed outputs on the Gradio interface by clicking the ClearButton.

**Output Example**:
("", output1, output2, "", code, "")

### FunctionDef setup_gradio_interface(self)
**setup_gradio_interface**: The function of setup_gradio_interface is to create a Gradio interface for interacting with the RepoAgent chat system.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The setup_gradio_interface function initializes a Gradio interface for users to interact with the chat system. It defines various input elements such as textboxes and buttons for user input and interaction. The function formats the output sections for response, embedding recall, and code display using HTML and CSS styling. Additionally, it links the input elements to the wrapper_respond function for handling user inputs and displaying formatted outputs on the interface. The clean function is linked to a ClearButton element to reset the input fields and displayed outputs.

This function is a part of the GradioInterface class in the gradio_interface.py file within the chat_with_repo module. It leverages the wrapper_respond function to format the outputs of the respond function and provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the chat system.

**Note**:
- Users can input questions and optional instructions, submit them using the "Submit" button, and view the formatted responses, embedding recall, and code outputs.
- The "record" button functionality is not explicitly defined in the provided code snippet.
- Clicking the "Clear" button resets the input fields and displayed outputs on the Gradio interface.
