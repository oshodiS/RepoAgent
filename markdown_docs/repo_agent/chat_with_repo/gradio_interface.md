## ClassDef GradioInterface
**GradioInterface**: The function of GradioInterface is to create a user interface for interacting with a chatbot system.

**attributes**:
- respond: A function that handles responses from the chatbot.
- cssa: CSS styling for the interface.
- cssb: CSS styling for the interface.
  
**Code Description**:
The GradioInterface class initializes with a respond function and CSS styling for the interface. It contains methods to format responses, clean the interface, and set up the Gradio interface for user interaction. The wrapper_respond method formats the chatbot responses using CSS styling. The clean method resets the interface to its initial state. The setup_gradio_interface method configures the Gradio interface with input fields, buttons, and output areas for the chatbot responses.

When called in the project, the GradioInterface class is instantiated with the respond function from the RepoAssistant class in main.py. This allows users to interact with the chatbot system through the Gradio interface.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the CSS styling in the GradioInterface class to modify the appearance of the interface.

**Output Example**:
A formatted response displayed in the Gradio interface:
Response:
[Chatbot response content]

Embedding Recall:
[Embedding recall content]

Code:
[Code snippet content]
### FunctionDef __init__(self, respond_function)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the GradioInterface object with a respond_function parameter.

**parameters**:
- respond_function: A function that handles responses within the Gradio interface.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the GradioInterface object by assigning the respond_function parameter to the self.respond attribute. It also defines CSS styles for the interface using self.cssa and self.cssb variables. These styles include settings for outer and inner boxes, titles, content display, and scrolling.

Furthermore, the function calls the setup_gradio_interface method to configure the Gradio interface for interacting with the RepoAgent chat system. This setup includes defining input elements for user questions and system instructions, along with buttons for submission and clearing. Additionally, output elements are set up for displaying response messages, embedding recall information, and code snippets.

The HTML elements are styled using predefined CSS classes to ensure a consistent visual appearance. The setup_gradio_interface function is responsible for linking button click events to appropriate response handling functions, such as wrapper_respond for message submission and clean for interface reset. Finally, the Gradio interface is launched with specified height and sharing settings.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the defined CSS styles align with the interface design requirements.
- The setup_gradio_interface function encapsulates the configuration of the chat interface and its interaction components.
- The __init__ function plays a crucial role in initializing the GradioInterface object and setting up the necessary components for interaction with the chat system.

### FunctionDef wrapper_respond(self, msg_input, system_input)
**wrapper_respond**: The function of wrapper_respond is to process the outputs of the respond function by converting them into markdown format and embedding them into HTML templates before returning them.

**parameters**:
- msg_input: Represents the message input.
- system_input: Represents the system input.

**Code Description**:
The wrapper_respond function first calls the respond function to retrieve msg, output1, output2, output3, code, and codex. It then converts output1, output2, and code into markdown format. Next, it embeds the markdown-formatted outputs into HTML templates with specific titles. Finally, it returns msg, output1, output2, output3, code, and codex.

In the setup_gradio_interface function, wrapper_respond is linked to the submit button click event and the message submission event. When the submit button is clicked or the message is submitted, the wrapper_respond function is triggered with msg_input and system_input as inputs. The outputs of the function are then displayed in the corresponding HTML elements on the interface.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the inputs msg_input and system_input are correctly provided to the function to process the outputs effectively.
- The function assumes that the respond function returns the required outputs in the specified order.

**Output Example**:
```python
msg = "How are you?"
system_input = "Provide instructions"
msg_output, output1, output2, output3, code_output, codex_output = wrapper_respond(msg, system_input)

# Possible output format
msg_output: "Response message"
output1: "<div class='title'>Response</div> <div class='inner-box'> <div class='content'> Output 1 content </div> </div> </div>"
output2: "<div class='title'>Embedding Recall</div> <div class='inner-box'> <div class='content'> Output 2 content </div> </div>"
output3: "Keywords"
code_output: "<div class='title'>Code</div> <div class='inner-box'> <div class='content'> Code content </div> </div>"
codex_output: "Additional code information"
```

### FunctionDef clean(self)
**clean**: The function of clean is to generate HTML outputs for different sections of a Gradio interface setup.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `clean` function creates HTML outputs for different sections of a Gradio interface setup. It initializes various HTML elements for the "Response", "Embedding Recall", and "Code" sections. The function then returns these HTML elements as outputs.

In the `clean` function, `output1`, `output2`, and `code` are initialized with HTML content for the respective sections. The function constructs HTML elements using predefined CSS styles and concatenates them with specific content for each section. The function does not take any parameters and returns the constructed HTML elements as outputs.

The `clean` function is called within the `setup_gradio_interface` function of the `GradioInterface` class. In the `setup_gradio_interface` function, the `clean` function is associated with the clear button (`btnc.click(self.clean)`) to reset the interface elements when the clear button is clicked. This ensures that the interface is cleaned and ready for new inputs.

**Note**:
- The `clean` function is specifically designed to handle the cleaning functionality of the Gradio interface setup.
- Ensure that the HTML content generated by the `clean` function aligns with the design and layout requirements of the interface.

**Output Example**:
```python
msg = ""
output1 = gr.HTML(...)  # HTML content for the "Response" section
output2 = gr.HTML(...)  # HTML content for the "Embedding Recall" section
output3 = ""  # Empty string
code = gr.HTML(...)  # HTML content for the "Code" section
codex = ""  # Empty string

return msg, output1, output2, output3, code, codex
```

### FunctionDef setup_gradio_interface(self)
**setup_gradio_interface**: The function of setup_gradio_interface is to initialize a Gradio interface for interacting with the RepoAgent chat system. It sets up input elements for user questions and system instructions, along with buttons for submission and clearing. The function also configures output elements for response messages, embedding recall, and code display.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The setup_gradio_interface function creates a Gradio interface with input elements for user questions and system instructions. It includes buttons for submitting queries, clearing the interface, and recording interactions. The function sets up output sections for displaying response messages, embedding recall information, and code snippets. The HTML elements are styled using predefined CSS classes to maintain a consistent look and feel.

The function links the submit button click event and message submission event to the wrapper_respond function, which processes the inputs and generates formatted outputs for display. Additionally, the clear button is associated with the clean function to reset the interface elements when needed. Finally, the function launches the Gradio interface with the specified height and sharing settings.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the CSS styles defined in the function align with the design requirements of the interface.
- The function relies on wrapper_respond and clean functions to handle input processing and output generation within the Gradio interface setup.

## FunctionDef respond_function(msg, system)
**respond_function**: The function of respond_function is to process a message and return the message along with other outputs.

**parameters**:
- msg: Represents the message input to the function.
- system: Represents the system input to the function.

**Code Description**:
The respond_function takes in a message (msg) and a system parameter. It then assigns an empty string to the variable RAG. Finally, the function returns the original message (msg), the empty string RAG, and three placeholder strings: "Embedding_recall_output", "Key_words_output", and "Code_output".

**Note**:
- The function does not perform any specific processing on the message or system inputs, it simply returns them along with placeholder strings.
- Developers may need to modify the function to include actual processing logic based on the requirements.

**Output Example**:
("Hello, how are you?", "", "Embedding_recall_output", "Key_words_output", "Code_output")
