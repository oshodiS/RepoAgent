## ClassDef GradioInterface
**GradioInterface**: The function of GradioInterface is to create a user interface for interacting with a chatbot and displaying responses, embedding recalls, and code snippets.

**attributes**:
- respond: A function that handles the response logic of the chatbot.
- cssa: CSS styling for the interface.
- cssb: Closing HTML tags for the interface styling.

**Code Description**:
The `GradioInterface` class initializes with a `respond_function` parameter, sets up CSS styling for the interface, and defines methods for processing user inputs and displaying chatbot responses. The `wrapper_respond` method formats the chatbot outputs using HTML and CSS styling. The `clean` method resets the interface elements. The `setup_gradio_interface` method creates the Gradio interface with input fields for user questions and system instructions, and displays response, embedding recall, and code outputs.

The `GradioInterface` class is instantiated in the `main` function of `main.py` in the `chat_with_repo` module. It is passed the `assistant.respond` function to handle chatbot responses within the Gradio interface.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the CSS styling in the `cssa` and `cssb` attributes to modify the appearance of the interface.

**Output Example**:
A mock-up of the chatbot response, embedding recall, and code snippet displayed in the Gradio interface:
```
Response:
<div class="outer-box">
    <div class="title">Response</div>
    <div class="inner-box">
        <div class="content">
            Chatbot response here.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Embedding Recall:
<div class="outer-box">
    <div class="title">Embedding Recall</div>
    <div class="inner-box">
        <div class="content">
            Embedding recall content here.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

Code:
<div class="outer-box">
    <div class="title">Code</div>
    <div class="inner-box">
        <div class="content">
            Code snippet here.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, respond_function)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the GradioInterface object with the provided respond_function.

**parameters**:
- respond_function: A function that handles responses within the GradioInterface.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function sets the respond attribute to the provided respond_function. It also initializes CSS styles for the Gradio interface, including outer-box, title, inner-box, and content. Furthermore, it calls the setup_gradio_interface function to configure the Gradio interface for interaction.

The setup_gradio_interface function creates a Gradio interface with input fields for questions and instructions, along with buttons for submission and clearing. It defines sections for displaying responses, embedding recall, and code outputs. The function utilizes CSS styling to enhance the visual presentation of the interface. Callback functions are established for user interactions such as submitting messages and clearing inputs. The interface layout is configured with specified settings for sharing and height before launching.

**Note**:
- Developers can customize the CSS styling and layout of the Gradio interface within the setup_gradio_interface function.
- Ensure correct linkage of callback functions to maintain functionality in the Gradio interface.

### FunctionDef wrapper_respond(self, msg_input, system_input)
**wrapper_respond**: The function of wrapper_respond is to process the input messages and system input, then format the outputs using Markdown and CSS before returning them.

**parameters**:
- msg_input: Represents the input message.
- system_input: Represents the system input.

**Code Description**:
The wrapper_respond function first calls the respond function with the provided msg_input and system_input. It then formats the output1, output2, and code using Markdown. The function further adds CSS styling to output1, output2, and code to enhance the visual presentation. Finally, it returns the processed message, output1, output2, output3, code, and codex.

In the calling situation within the project, the setup_gradio_interface function in GradioInterface class utilizes the wrapper_respond function as a callback for user interactions. When the user submits a message or clicks a button, the wrapper_respond function is triggered to process the inputs and generate formatted outputs for display in the Gradio interface.

**Note**: Developers can customize the CSS styling and Markdown formatting within the wrapper_respond function to adjust the visual appearance of the outputs.

**Output Example**:
```python
msg = "How are you?"
system_input = "Provide instructions"
msg_output, output1, output2, output3, code_output, codex = wrapper_respond(msg, system_input)

# Example output values after processing
print(msg_output)
print(output1)
print(output2)
print(output3)
print(code_output)
print(codex)
```
***
### FunctionDef clean(self)
**clean**: The function of clean is to generate HTML outputs for different sections of a Gradio interface.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `clean` function creates HTML outputs for different sections of a Gradio interface. It initializes various HTML elements such as response, embedding recall, and code sections using predefined CSS styles. The function then returns these HTML elements as outputs.

This function is called within the `setup_gradio_interface` function of the `GradioInterface` class. In the `setup_gradio_interface` function, the `clean` function is linked to a ClearButton element, allowing users to clear the input fields and reset the interface when the ClearButton is clicked.

**Note**:
- The `clean` function does not take any parameters and is solely responsible for generating HTML outputs.
- Ensure that the CSS styles used in the function align with the overall design of the Gradio interface.

**Output Example**:
```python
msg = ""
output1 = <HTML element representing the Response section>
output2 = <HTML element representing the Embedding Recall section>
output3 = ""
code = <HTML element representing the Code section>
codex = ""
```
***
### FunctionDef setup_gradio_interface(self)
**setup_gradio_interface**: The function of setup_gradio_interface is to create a Gradio interface for interacting with the RepoAgent chat system. It sets up input fields for user questions and system instructions, along with buttons for submission and clearing. The function also includes sections for displaying responses, embedding recall, and code outputs.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The setup_gradio_interface function initializes a Gradio interface using the gr.Blocks() context manager. It defines input elements such as textboxes for questions and instructions, as well as buttons for submission and clearing. The function creates HTML sections for displaying response, embedding recall, and code outputs within the interface. These sections are styled using CSS to enhance the visual presentation.

The setup_gradio_interface function utilizes the wrapper_respond function to process user inputs and generate formatted outputs for display in the Gradio interface. It establishes callback functions for user interactions such as submitting messages and clearing inputs. The function configures the interface layout and launches it with specified settings for sharing and height.

**Note**:
- Developers can customize the CSS styling and layout of the Gradio interface within the setup_gradio_interface function to suit their design preferences.
- Ensure that the callback functions for user interactions are correctly linked to the corresponding elements in the Gradio interface to maintain functionality.
***
## FunctionDef respond_function(msg, system)
**respond_function**: The function of respond_function is to process a message and return it along with other outputs.

**parameters**:
- msg: Represents the message input to the function.
- system: Represents the system input to the function.

**Code Description**:
The respond_function takes in a message (msg) and a system parameter. It then assigns an empty string to the variable RAG. Finally, it returns the original message (msg), the empty string RAG, and three additional outputs: "Embedding_recall_output", "Key_words_output", and "Code_output".

**Note**:
- This function seems to be a placeholder or a stub as the RAG variable is assigned an empty string without any further processing.
- The purpose of the function and the significance of the returned outputs are not clear from the provided code snippet.

**Output Example**:
If the function is called with msg = "Hello" and system = "AI", the return value could be ("Hello", "", "Embedding_recall_output", "Key_words_output", "Code_output").
