The GradioInterface class enhances the user experience by providing a visually appealing and interactive platform for communication with the chatbot.

**Note**: Developers can customize the CSS styling and interface layout according to their requirements. Ensure the respond function returns the necessary outputs for proper display in the interface.

**Output Example**:
A user interface displaying chatbot responses, embedding recall information, and code snippets in styled HTML elements.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, respond_function)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the GradioInterface object with a respond_function parameter.

**parameters**:
- respond_function: A function that handles responses within the Gradio interface.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the GradioInterface object by assigning the respond_function parameter to the self.respond attribute. It also sets up CSS styling variables (self.cssa and self.cssb) to format HTML outputs consistently with the Gradio interface design. Additionally, the function calls the setup_gradio_interface method to configure the Gradio interface components for user interaction.

The self.respond attribute stores the function responsible for generating responses based on user inputs. The CSS styling variables define the visual appearance of the interface elements, ensuring a cohesive design. By invoking the setup_gradio_interface method, the function prepares the Gradio interface with input textboxes, buttons, HTML elements, and output sections for response display, embedding recall, and code presentation.

The setup_gradio_interface function establishes event handlers for user interactions such as button clicks, text submissions, and interface clearing. It integrates various components to enhance user experience and facilitate communication with the RepoAgent chat system. The function's execution enables users to interact effectively with the chat system through the Gradio interface.

**Note**: Prior to calling the setup_gradio_interface method, ensure that the respond_function parameter is correctly defined to handle user queries and responses. The CSS styling variables play a crucial role in maintaining a visually appealing interface design. The setup_gradio_interface function is essential for initializing the Gradio interface and enabling seamless user interactions within the RepoAgent chat system.

### FunctionDef wrapper_respond(self, msg_input, system_input)
**wrapper_respond**: The function of wrapper_respond is to enhance the output of the respond function by formatting the response, embedding recall, and code in HTML format.

**parameters**:
- msg_input: Input message for the respond function.
- system_input: Optional system input for the respond function.

**Code Description**:
The wrapper_respond function takes two input parameters, msg_input, and system_input. It then calls the respond function with these inputs to retrieve msg, output1, output2, output3, code, and codex. The function formats output1, output2, and code using the markdown library and embeds them in HTML format with specific CSS classes. Finally, it returns the formatted message and outputs.

This function is utilized in the setup_gradio_interface function of the GradioInterface class in the gradio_interface.py file. In the setup_gradio_interface function, wrapper_respond is linked to the submit button click event to process user inputs and display formatted responses in the Gradio interface. The function plays a crucial role in enhancing the user experience by presenting the response, embedding recall, and code in a visually appealing manner.

**Note**: Ensure that the CSS classes used in the HTML formatting align with the styling of the Gradio interface to maintain a consistent look and feel.

**Output Example**:
```python
msg = "Hello, how can I help you?"
output1 = """
    <div class="title">Response</div>
    <div class="inner-box">
        <div class="content">
            <p>This is the response to your query.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
"""
output2 = """
    <div class="title">Embedding Recall</div>
    <div class="inner-box">
        <div class="content">
            <p>Embedding recall information here.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
"""
output3 = "relevant keywords"
code = """
    <div class="title">Code</div>
    <div class="inner-box">
        <div class="content">
            <code>Sample code snippet</code>
        </div>
    </div>
"""
codex = "additional code information"
```

### FunctionDef clean(self)
**clean**: The function of clean is to generate HTML outputs for different sections of a Gradio interface.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The clean function creates HTML outputs for three different sections: Response, Embedding Recall, and Code. Each section is enclosed within specific HTML tags to structure the content properly. The function returns these HTML outputs along with an empty message and code.

In the project, the clean function is called by the setup_gradio_interface function in the GradioInterface class. When the user clicks on the clear button in the Gradio interface, the clean function is triggered to reset the output sections.

**Note**: Ensure that the CSS styling variables (self.cssa and self.cssb) are properly defined before calling the clean function to generate the HTML outputs.

**Output Example**:
("", output1, output2, "", code, "")
