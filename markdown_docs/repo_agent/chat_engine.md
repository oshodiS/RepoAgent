## ClassDef ResponseMessage
**ResponseMessage**: The function of ResponseMessage is to store a string content.

**attributes**: 
- content: a string that represents the content of the response message.

**Code Description**: 
The ResponseMessage class defines an object that holds a string content representing a response message. This class has one attribute:
- content: a string that stores the actual content of the response message.

The class is utilized within the project in the `attempt_generate_response` method of the `ChatEngine` class. In this method, an instance of ResponseMessage is created to handle cases where an unknown error occurs while generating documentation after multiple attempts. The ResponseMessage instance is returned with a specific error message in such scenarios.

**Note**: 
Developers can utilize the ResponseMessage class to encapsulate and manage response messages within the chat engine functionality.
## ClassDef ChatEngine
**ChatEngine**: The function of ChatEngine is to generate the documentation of functions or classes.

**attributes**:
- `project_manager`: An instance of the ProjectManager class that manages the project's hierarchy.

**Code Description**:
The ChatEngine class is responsible for generating documentation for functions or classes. It contains several methods that facilitate the generation of documentation based on the provided code.

The `num_tokens_from_string` method takes a text string as input and returns the number of tokens in the string. It uses the `tiktoken` library to encode the string and then calculates the length of the encoded tokens.

The `reduce_input_length` method is used to shorten the length of input prompts by modifying the `sys_prompt` contents. It takes two parameters: `shorten_attempt` and `prompt_data`. The method first logs the attempt number to reduce the length of the messages. In the first attempt, it removes the `project_structure` and `project_structure_prefix` from the `prompt_data`. In the second attempt, it further removes the caller and callee (reference) information from the `prompt_data`. Finally, it updates the `sys_prompt` with the modified `prompt_data` and returns it.

The `generate_response` method generates a response message using the OpenAI API. It takes four parameters: `model`, `sys_prompt`, `usr_prompt`, and `max_tokens`. It creates a list of messages containing the system prompt and user prompt, and then sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a response. The response message is extracted from the API response and returned.

The `attempt_generate_response` method is used to attempt generating a response message. It takes five parameters: `model`, `sys_prompt`, `usr_prompt`, `max_tokens`, and `max_attempts`. It tries to generate a response message using the `generate_response` method. If the response message is None, it retries the request after a delay. If there is a connection error, it logs the error and retries the request. If there is an unknown error, it logs the error and retries the request. After a maximum number of attempts, it either raises an exception or returns a default response message.

The `generate_doc` method generates documentation for a given `doc_item` using a `file_handler`. It first extracts relevant information from the `doc_item` and sets up the initial prompt data. It then constructs the system prompt and user prompt using the prompt data and language settings. If the total number of tokens exceeds the maximum input length for the model, it tries to find a larger model or shorten the input length. If the total tokens are within the limit, it attempts to generate a response message using the `attempt_generate_response` method. The response message is returned.

**Note**: The code is designed to handle cases where the code length exceeds the model's maximum input length. It tries to find a larger model or shorten the input length to generate the documentation. However, if the code itself is too long to process, the documentation generation may fail.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.

Please note:
- The documentation generation process may involve making requests to external APIs and may take some time to complete.
- The generated documentation is based on the provided code and may not be accurate or complete. It is recommended to review and verify the generated documentation before using it.

**parameters**:
- model: The model used for generating the response.
- sys_prompt: The system prompt to provide context for the response.
- usr_prompt: The user prompt to provide additional information for the response.
- max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens in the response.

**Code Description**:
The generate_response function initializes a client to interact with the OpenAI API using the provided API key, base URL, and timeout settings. It then creates a list of messages containing system and user prompts. The function sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a completion based on the model, messages, temperature, and max_tokens. Finally, it retrieves the response message from the API's output and returns it.

In the calling object "attempt_generate_response", the generate_response function is utilized within a loop to make multiple attempts at generating a response. If the response message is None, the function continues to the next attempt. If an API connection error occurs, the function logs the error, retries after a specified time, and continues with the next attempt. If an unknown error occurs, the function logs the error, retries after a different time, and handles the situation accordingly.

**Note**: It's important to handle potential API connection errors and unknown errors gracefully to ensure the reliability of the response generation process.

**parameters**:
- model: The model used for generating the response.
- sys_prompt: The system prompt to provide context for the response.
- usr_prompt: The user prompt to provide additional information for the response.
- max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens in the response.
- max_attempts: The maximum number of attempts to generate a response (default is 5).

**Code Description**:
The attempt_generate_response function attempts to generate a response by calling the generate_response function multiple times. It uses a while loop to control the number of attempts. Within each attempt, it calls the generate_response function and checks if the response message is None. If the response message is None, it increments the attempt counter and continues to the next attempt. If the response message is not None, it returns the response message.

The function also handles potential API connection errors and unknown errors. If an API connection error occurs, it logs the error, waits for 7 seconds, increments the attempt counter, and continues to the next attempt. If an unknown error occurs, it logs the error, waits for 10 seconds, increments the attempt counter, and continues to the next attempt. If the maximum number of attempts is reached without a successful response, it raises an exception or returns a specific error message.

The attempt_generate_response function is utilized within the ChatEngine class to handle cases where generating a response fails. It provides a mechanism to retry generating a response multiple times, allowing for potential errors or issues with the OpenAI API.

**Note**:
Developers should be aware of the potential errors that can occur during response generation and handle them gracefully. They can adjust the maximum number of attempts and the sleep duration between attempts based on their specific requirements and the reliability of the OpenAI API.

**Output Example**:
A response message generated based on the provided prompts and model.

Please note that the content of the response message will vary depending on the specific prompts and model used.
***
### FunctionDef generate_doc(self, doc_item, file_handler)
**generate_doc**: The function of generate_doc is to generate documentation for a given DocItem object. It takes the DocItem object, along with a file handler, as input parameters. The function retrieves the necessary information from the DocItem object, such as the code type, name, content, and references. It also builds the project structure based on the references and the file path of the DocItem object.

The function then constructs a prompt for generating the documentation by formatting the retrieved information into a system prompt and a user prompt. It determines the appropriate model to use for generating the response based on the maximum input length. If the total tokens in the prompts exceed the model's limit, the function attempts to use a larger model or reduce the input length to meet the requirements.

Once the prompts are prepared, the function makes a request to the OpenAI API to generate the documentation. It handles potential API connection errors and unknown errors by retrying the request multiple times with a delay between attempts. If a response message is obtained, it is returned as the result of the function.

The generate_doc function plays a crucial role in the documentation generation process. It utilizes the capabilities of the OpenAI API to generate accurate and informative documentation based on the provided code and project structure. Developers can rely on this function to automate the documentation generation process and ensure that the documentation remains up-to-date with the codebase.

**Parameters**:
- `doc_item` (DocItem): The DocItem object representing the documentation item to be generated.
- `file_handler` (FileHandler): The file handler object for reading and writing files.

**Code Description**:
The generate_doc function begins by extracting the necessary information from the `doc_item` object, such as the code type, name, content, and references. It also retrieves the file path of the `doc_item` object and constructs the full path to the `doc_item` object within the project hierarchy.

Next, the function builds the project structure by calling the `build_path_tree` method of the `ProjectManager` class. This method constructs a tree structure based on the references and the file path of the `doc_item` object. The resulting tree structure is then converted into a string representation.

The function proceeds to construct the prompts for generating the documentation. It formats the retrieved information into a system prompt and a user prompt, using placeholders to insert the values dynamically. The system prompt provides context for the response generation, while the user prompt provides additional information for the response.

After preparing the prompts, the function determines the appropriate model to use for generating the response. It checks if the total tokens in the prompts exceed the maximum input length of the model. If it does, the function attempts to use a larger model with a higher input limit. If no larger models are available, the function reduces the input length by modifying the system prompt.

Once the prompts are ready, the function makes a request to the OpenAI API to generate the documentation. It handles potential API connection errors and unknown errors by retrying the request multiple times with a delay between attempts. If a response message is obtained, it is returned as the result of the function.

The generate_doc function is a critical component of the documentation generation system.

#### FunctionDef get_referencer_prompt(doc_item)
**get_referencer_prompt**: The function of `get_referencer_prompt` is to generate a prompt that displays the objects that have called the current object, along with their code and documentation.

**Parameters**:
- `doc_item` (DocItem): The `DocItem` object representing the current documentation item.

**Code Description**:
The `get_referencer_prompt` function first checks if the `who_reference_me` list of the `doc_item` is empty. If it is, the function returns an empty string.

If the `who_reference_me` list is not empty, the function initializes a list called `prompt` with a single string element. This element serves as the introductory sentence for the prompt.

Next, the function iterates over the `who_reference_me` list using the `enumerate` function to access both the index and the `referencer_item` object. For each `referencer_item`, the function generates a prompt string that includes the object's name, documentation, and code content.

The prompt string is constructed by concatenating the following elements:
- The object's name obtained from `referencer_item.get_full_name()`.
- The word "Document:" followed by the documentation content of the `referencer_item` object. If the `md_content` list of the `referencer_item` is not empty, the last element of the list is used. Otherwise, the string "None" is used.
- The word "Raw code:" followed by the code content of the `referencer_item` object. If the `content` dictionary of the `referencer_item` contains the key "code_content", the corresponding value is used. Otherwise, the string "None" is used.
- A line of equal signs ("=") to separate each prompt.

The constructed prompt string is then appended to the `prompt` list. After iterating over all the `who_reference_me` objects, the function joins the elements of the `prompt` list using newline characters ("\n") as the separator and returns the resulting string.

**Note**:
- The `get_referencer_prompt` function is designed to provide information about the objects that have called the current object. It relies on the `who_reference_me` list of the `DocItem` object to determine the calling objects.
- The prompt generated by this function can be used to display the calling objects, their documentation, and code content, allowing developers to understand the relationships and dependencies between different parts of the codebase.

**Output Example**:
If the `who_reference_me` list contains two `DocItem` objects with the following information:
- Object 1:
    - Name: "obj1"
    - Documentation: "This is the documentation for obj1."
    - Code content: "def obj1_func():\n    print('This is obj1 function.')"
- Object 2:
    - Name: "obj2"
    - Documentation: "This is the documentation for obj2."
    - Code content: "def obj2_func():\n    print('This is obj2 function.')"

The output of the `get_referencer_prompt` function would be:
```
Also, the code has been called by the following objects, their code and docs are as following:
obj: obj1
Document: 
This is the documentation for obj1.
Raw code:
def obj1_func():
    print('This is obj1 function.')
==========
obj: obj2
Document: 
This is the documentation for obj2.
Raw code:
def obj2_func():
    print('This is obj2 function.')
==========
