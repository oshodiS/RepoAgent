## ClassDef ResponseMessage
**ResponseMessage**: The function of ResponseMessage is to represent a response message with content stored as a string.

**attributes**: 
- content: A string that stores the content of the response message.

**Code Description**: 
The `ResponseMessage` class defines a structure for handling response messages in the chat engine. It contains a single attribute `content` which stores the actual message content as a string. This class is utilized to create instances of response messages that can be returned by the chat engine during interactions. 

The `ResponseMessage` class is called within the `attempt_generate_response` method of the `ChatEngine` class. In the `attempt_generate_response` method, an instance of `ResponseMessage` is returned based on the response generated by the chat engine. If an error occurs during the response generation process, a custom `ResponseMessage` instance is created to handle the error message.

The class provides a simple yet essential structure for managing response messages within the chat engine, allowing for the encapsulation of message content in a standardized format.

**Note**: 
Ensure to utilize the `content` attribute to access and manipulate the content of the response message instances created using the `ResponseMessage` class.
## ClassDef ChatEngine
**ChatEngine**: The function of ChatEngine is to generate the documentation of functions or classes.

**attributes**:
- project_manager: The project manager object that handles the project hierarchy.

**Code Description**:
The ChatEngine class is responsible for generating documentation for functions or classes. It contains several methods that facilitate the generation of documentation.

The `num_tokens_from_string` method takes a text string as input and returns the number of tokens in the string. It uses the `tiktoken` library to encode the string and then counts the number of tokens in the encoded string.

The `reduce_input_length` method is used to shorten the length of input prompts by modifying the `sys_prompt` contents. It takes two parameters, `shorten_attempt` and `prompt_data`, and updates the `prompt_data` object based on the `shorten_attempt` value. It removes certain parts of the `prompt_data` object to reduce the length of the input prompts.

The `generate_response` method generates a response using the OpenAI API. It takes the model, system prompt (`sys_prompt`), user prompt (`usr_prompt`), and maximum number of tokens (`max_tokens`) as input. It creates a list of messages containing the system and user prompts, and sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a response. The response message is then returned.

The `attempt_generate_response` method is used to handle potential errors and retries when generating a response. It takes the same parameters as the `generate_response` method, along with an optional `max_attempts` parameter. It attempts to generate a response using the `generate_response` method, and if an error occurs, it retries the request up to `max_attempts` times. It handles specific types of errors, such as API connection errors, and waits for a certain amount of time before retrying.

The `generate_doc` method is the main method of the ChatEngine class. It takes a `doc_item` object and a `file_handler` object as input. It extracts information from the `doc_item` object, such as the code type, name, content, and whether it has a return value. It also retrieves information about the objects that reference or are referenced by the `doc_item` object. It then constructs a system prompt (`sys_prompt`) and user prompt (`usr_prompt`) using the extracted information. The method determines the appropriate model to use based on the length of the prompts and sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a response. The response message is returned as the result.

**Note**: The ChatEngine class is designed to generate documentation for functions or classes. It utilizes the OpenAI API for text generation and handles potential errors and retries. The `generate_doc` method is the entry point for generating documentation based on a `doc_item` object.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.

Please note:
- The ChatEngine class relies on the OpenAI API for text generation. Make sure to provide the necessary API key and configure the base URL and timeout settings accordingly.
- The `generate_doc` method requires a `doc_item` object and a `file_handler` object as input. Ensure that these objects are properly instantiated and passed to the method.
- The `attempt_generate_response` method handles potential errors and retries when generating a response. Adjust the `max_attempts` parameter as needed for your specific use case.
- The `reduce_input_length` method is used to shorten the length of input prompts. Customize the logic in this method based on your specific requirements.
- The `num_tokens_from_string` method relies on the `tiktoken` library for tokenization. Make sure to install and import the library before using this method.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, project_manager)

**num_tokens_from_string**: The function of num_tokens_from_string is to return the number of tokens in a text string.
**parameters**: 
- string: A string representing the text for which the number of tokens needs to be calculated.
- encoding_name: A string specifying the encoding name to be used (default value is "cl100k_base").

**Code Description**: The num_tokens_from_string function takes a text string and an optional encoding name as input. It then retrieves the encoding based on the provided encoding name using the tiktoken.get_encoding method. Subsequently, the function calculates the number of tokens in the text string using the length of the encoded string obtained from the encoding. Finally, it returns the total number of tokens as an integer.

This function is utilized in the project to determine the number of tokens in a text string, which is essential for various text processing tasks within the chat engine module.

**Note**: Ensure that the input string is a valid text string, and the encoding name is compatible with the encoding system used in the project.

**Output Example**: 
If the input string is "Hello, world!", and the encoding name is "cl100k_base", the function would return 3 as the number of tokens in the text string.
***
### FunctionDef reduce_input_length(self, shorten_attempt, prompt_data)
**reduce_input_length**: The function of reduce_input_length is to reduce the length of the input prompts by modifying the sys_prompt contents.

**parameters**:
- shorten_attempt: An integer representing the attempt number to shorten the input prompts.
- prompt_data: Data structure containing information about the prompt.

**Code Description**:
The reduce_input_length function is responsible for adjusting the length of input prompts by manipulating the sys_prompt contents based on the shorten_attempt value. It first logs the attempt number to reduce the length of the messages. Depending on the shorten_attempt value, it modifies the prompt_data structure to remove specific information from the prompt. Finally, it updates the sys_prompt by formatting it with the modified prompt_data and returns the updated sys_prompt.

This function is called within the project's chat_engine module to manage the length of input prompts in the chat system. It is utilized in scenarios where the total tokens of the sys_prompt and usr_prompt exceed the maximum input length supported by the model. By reducing the input length through multiple attempts, the function aims to generate a response within the model's constraints.

**Note**:
- The function is designed to handle input prompt length reduction specifically within the chat system.
- It is crucial to ensure that the total tokens of the sys_prompt and usr_prompt do not exceed the maximum input length to avoid processing issues.

**Output Example**:
A possible appearance of the code's return value after reducing the input prompt length.

***
### FunctionDef attempt_generate_response(self, model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, max_tokens, max_attempts)
**attempt_generate_response**: The function of attempt_generate_response is to attempt generating a response using the provided model, system prompt, user prompt, and maximum tokens.

**parameters**:
- model: The model used for generating the response.
- sys_prompt: The system prompt to provide context for the response.
- usr_prompt: The user prompt to guide the response generation.
- max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens in the response.
- max_attempts: The maximum number of attempts to generate a response.

**Code Description**:
The `attempt_generate_response` function is responsible for generating a response by calling the `generate_response` function. It attempts to generate a response using the provided model, system prompt, user prompt, and maximum tokens. The function uses a while loop to control the number of attempts made to generate a response.

Within the while loop, the function calls the `generate_response` function to generate a response message. If the response message is None, the attempt counter is incremented and the loop continues to the next iteration. This allows for multiple attempts to generate a response in case of errors or empty responses.

If an `APIConnectionError` occurs during the response generation process, the function logs the error message and retries after a 7-second delay. The attempt counter is incremented, and if the maximum number of attempts is reached, the function raises the exception.

If any other exception occurs, the function logs the error message and retries after a 10-second delay. The attempt counter is incremented, and if the maximum number of attempts is reached, the function creates a custom `ResponseMessage` instance with an error message and returns it.

The `attempt_generate_response` function provides error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure the generation of a response. It allows for fine-tuning the response generation process by specifying the maximum number of attempts and the delay between retries.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the necessary model, system prompt, user prompt, and maximum tokens are correctly provided before calling this function.
- Handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the response generation process.
- The function returns a `ResponseMessage` instance representing the generated response or an error message.

**Output Example**:
A possible appearance of the code's return value is a `ResponseMessage` instance containing the generated response message.
***
### FunctionDef generate_doc(self, doc_item, file_handler)
**generate_doc**: The function of generate_doc is to generate documentation for a given code item. It takes a `DocItem` object, which represents the code item to be documented, and a `file_handler` object, which provides access to the project's file system. The function retrieves the necessary information from the `DocItem` object, such as the code type, name, content, and reference relationships. It then builds the hierarchical structure of the project based on the reference relationships and the file path of the code item. 

The function also includes helper functions to retrieve information about the objects that reference the code item (`get_referenced_prompt`) and the objects that are referenced by the code item (`get_referencer_prompt`). These helper functions provide the code, documentation, and file paths of the referencing and referenced objects.

The function uses a combination of system and user prompts to generate a response message. It first constructs a system prompt (`sys_prompt`) using a predefined template and the information from the `DocItem` object. It also constructs a user prompt (`usr_prompt`) using a predefined template and the project's language setting.

The function then checks the total number of tokens in the prompts and determines whether it exceeds the maximum input length supported by the model. If it exceeds the limit, the function attempts to use a larger model or reduce the input length by modifying the prompts. If the total tokens are within the limit, the function sends a request to the chat completion model to generate the response message.

The generated response message is returned as the output of the function. It contains the documentation for the code item, including the code type, name, content, and reference relationships. If there are objects that reference the code item, the response message also includes their code and documentation. Similarly, if there are objects that are referenced by the code item, their code and documentation are also included in the response message.

The function provides a comprehensive and structured approach to generating documentation for code items in a project. It takes into account the hierarchical structure of the project, the reference relationships between code items, and the limitations of the chat completion model. By combining these elements, the function produces informative and accurate documentation for the target code item.

**Note**: Developers should ensure that the necessary input parameters are provided correctly when calling this function. They should also handle any exceptions or errors that may occur during the response generation process. The output of the function is a response message object, which contains the generated documentation for the code item. Developers can access the content of the response message to retrieve the documentation.
