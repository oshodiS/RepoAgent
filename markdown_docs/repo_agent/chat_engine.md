## ClassDef ResponseMessage
**ResponseMessage**: The function of ResponseMessage is to store a string content.

**attributes**: 
- content: a string that represents the content of the response message.

**Code Description**: 
The ResponseMessage class defines an object that holds a string content representing a response message. This class has a single attribute:
- content: This attribute stores the string content of the response message.

The class is designed to be used within the chat engine for handling response messages during interactions. It provides a simple structure to encapsulate the content of a response message.

**Note**: 
Developers can utilize the ResponseMessage class to create and manage response messages within the chat engine, enhancing the handling of communication between the system and users.
## ClassDef ChatEngine
**ChatEngine**: The function of ChatEngine is to generate the documentation of functions or classes.

**attributes**:
- project_manager: An instance of the ProjectManager class.

**Code Description**:
The ChatEngine class is responsible for generating documentation for functions or classes. It contains several methods that facilitate the generation of documentation based on the provided code.

The `num_tokens_from_string` method takes a text string as input and returns the number of tokens in the string. It uses the `tiktoken` library to encode the string and calculate the number of tokens.

The `reduce_input_length` method is used to shorten the length of input prompts by modifying the `sys_prompt` contents. It takes two parameters, `shorten_attempt` and `prompt_data`, and updates the `prompt_data` object based on the `shorten_attempt` value. It then updates the `sys_prompt` with the modified `prompt_data` and returns it.

The `generate_response` method generates a response using the OpenAI API. It takes the `model`, `sys_prompt`, `usr_prompt`, and `max_tokens` as input parameters. It creates a list of messages containing the system and user prompts, and sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a response. The response message is then returned.

The `attempt_generate_response` method attempts to generate a response using the `generate_response` method. It takes additional parameters `max_attempts` and `model`, and tries to generate a response multiple times in case of connection errors or unknown errors. It returns the response message if successful, or raises an exception if the maximum number of attempts is reached.

The `generate_doc` method is the main method of the ChatEngine class. It takes a `doc_item` object and a `file_handler` as input parameters. It extracts information from the `doc_item` object, such as the code type, name, content, and references. It then builds a prompt using the extracted information and sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate the documentation. The response message is returned.

**Note**: The ChatEngine class relies on the ProjectManager class to build the project structure and handle project-related operations.

**Output Example**: 
```
The function of ChatEngine is to generate the documentation of functions or classes.
```

**Code Description**:
In this function, the project manager passed as a parameter is assigned to the ChatEngine object's project_manager attribute. This allows the ChatEngine to interact with the project manager throughout its lifecycle.

**Note**:
It is essential to provide a valid project manager object when initializing a ChatEngine instance to ensure proper functionality and communication between the ChatEngine and the project manager.
***
### FunctionDef num_tokens_from_string(self, string, encoding_name)
**num_tokens_from_string**: The function of num_tokens_from_string is to return the number of tokens in a text string.

**parameters**: 
- string: A string representing the text for which the number of tokens needs to be calculated.
- encoding_name: A string specifying the encoding name to be used (default value is "cl100k_base").

**Code Description**: 
The num_tokens_from_string function calculates the number of tokens in a text string by utilizing the specified encoding. It first obtains the encoding based on the provided encoding name, then encodes the input string using this encoding to determine the number of tokens present in the string.

This function is designed to be used within a chat engine or similar application to process text data and analyze the token count within the text.

**Note**: 
Ensure that the input string is in a format compatible with the specified encoding to obtain accurate token count results.

**Output Example**: 
If the input string is "Hello, world!", the function may return 3 as the number of tokens based on the encoding used.
***
### FunctionDef reduce_input_length(self, shorten_attempt, prompt_data)
**reduce_input_length**: The function of reduce_input_length is to modify the input prompts by reducing their length through adjusting the sys_prompt contents.

**parameters**:
- shorten_attempt: An integer representing the attempt number to reduce the length of the messages.
- prompt_data: A data structure containing information about the input prompts.

**Code Description**:
The reduce_input_length function first logs the attempt number to reduce the message length. Depending on the shorten_attempt value, it modifies the prompt_data structure to shorten the input prompts. It then updates the sys_prompt by formatting the prompt_data. Finally, it returns the updated sys_prompt.

This function is called within the generate_doc function of the ChatEngine class in the chat_engine.py file. The generate_doc function is responsible for generating documentation for code items and involves handling references and relationships between different objects in the project.

**Note**: Ensure that the shorten_attempt parameter is either 0 or 1 to control the reduction process effectively.

**Output Example**:

***
### FunctionDef generate_response(self, model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, max_tokens)
**generate_response**: The function of generate_response is to interact with the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the provided model, system prompt, user prompt, and maximum tokens.

**parameters**:
- model: The model used for generating the response.
- sys_prompt: The system prompt to provide context for the response.
- usr_prompt: The user prompt to guide the response generation.
- max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens in the response.

**Code Description**:
The generate_response function initializes a client to interact with the OpenAI API using the provided API key, base URL, and timeout settings. It then creates a list of messages containing system and user prompts. The function sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a completion based on the model, messages, temperature, and maximum tokens. Finally, it retrieves the response message from the API's output and returns it.

This function is called by the attempt_generate_response method in the ChatEngine class. The attempt_generate_response method attempts to generate a response using the generate_response function with error handling for API connection errors and other exceptions. It retries the generation process with a delay if an error occurs, up to a specified number of attempts.

**Note**:
- Ensure the correct API key, base URL, and timeout settings are configured for the OpenAI client.
- Handle API connection errors and other exceptions appropriately in the calling method for robustness.

**Output Example**:
"Hello, how can I assist you today?"
***
### FunctionDef attempt_generate_response(self, model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, max_tokens, max_attempts)
**attempt_generate_response**: The function of attempt_generate_response is to attempt generating a response using the generate_response function with error handling for API connection errors and other exceptions. It retries the generation process with a delay if an error occurs, up to a specified number of attempts.

**parameters**:
- model: The model used for generating the response.
- sys_prompt: The system prompt to provide context for the response.
- usr_prompt: The user prompt to guide the response generation.
- max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens in the response.
- max_attempts (optional): The maximum number of attempts to generate a response. Default is 5.

**Code Description**:
The attempt_generate_response function is responsible for generating a response by calling the generate_response function. It takes the model, system prompt, user prompt, and maximum tokens as input parameters. Additionally, it allows specifying the maximum number of attempts to generate a response, with a default value of 5.

The function starts by initializing the attempt counter to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues until the attempt counter reaches the maximum number of attempts. Within the loop, it tries to generate a response by calling the generate_response function with the provided parameters.

If the response message is None, indicating an unsuccessful response generation, the attempt counter is incremented and the loop continues to the next iteration. This allows for retrying the generation process up to the specified maximum number of attempts.

If the response message is not None, indicating a successful response generation, the function returns the response message.

In case of an API connection error, the function catches the APIConnectionError exception and logs an error message with the specific error details and the current attempt number. It then waits for 7 seconds before incrementing the attempt counter and continuing to the next iteration of the loop. If the maximum number of attempts is reached, the function raises the exception to be handled by the caller.

For any other exception, the function catches the Exception base class, logs an error message with the specific error details and the current attempt number, and waits for 10 seconds before incrementing the attempt counter and continuing to the next iteration of the loop. If the maximum number of attempts is reached, the function creates a ResponseMessage object with an error message indicating an unknown error occurred while generating the documentation after many tries.

**Note**:
- Ensure the correct model, system prompt, user prompt, and maximum tokens are provided for generating the response.
- Handle API connection errors and other exceptions appropriately in the calling method for robustness.
- Adjust the maximum number of attempts according to the specific requirements and constraints of the application.

**Output Example**:
A possible appearance of the code's return value is a response message containing the generated response.
***
### FunctionDef generate_doc(self, doc_item, file_handler)
**generate_doc**: The function of generate_doc is to generate documentation for a given code item. It takes a DocItem object, which contains information about the code item, and a file_handler object, which provides access to the project files. The function retrieves the necessary information from the DocItem object, such as the code type, name, content, and whether it has a return value. It also checks if the code item is referenced by other objects or references other objects in the project.

The function then uses the ProjectManager instance to build the hierarchical structure of the project based on the who_reference_me and reference_who lists, as well as the doc_item_path. This structure represents the relationships between different objects in the project. The project_structure is a string representation of the hierarchical structure, with the current object marked with an asterisk (*).

Next, the function defines helper functions to retrieve the code and documentation of the objects that reference or are referenced by the current code item. These functions iterate over the reference_who and who_reference_me lists, respectively, and generate prompts containing the object's name, documentation, and raw code. These prompts are then included in the final documentation.

The function also includes a helper function to describe the relationship between the current code item and its callers and callees in the project. This description is based on whether there are objects that reference or are referenced by the current code item.

The function then constructs the main prompt, which includes information about the code item, its type, name, content, and whether it has a return value. It also includes prompts about the referenced and referencer objects, the hierarchical structure of the project, and the relationship between the current code item and its callers and callees.

After constructing the prompt, the function checks the total number of tokens in the prompt and the maximum input length allowed by the model. If the total tokens exceed the limit, the function tries to use a larger model or reduce the input length by removing certain parts of the prompt. If the total tokens are within the limit, the function sends a request to the chat completion model to generate the documentation.

Finally, the function returns the response message, which contains the generated documentation for the code item.

**parameters**:
- doc_item: A DocItem object representing the code item for which documentation needs to be generated.
- file_handler: A file_handler object providing access to the project files.

**Code Description**:
The generate_doc function is responsible for generating documentation for a given code item in the project. It takes a DocItem object, which contains information about the code item, and a file_handler object, which provides access to the project files.

The function first retrieves the necessary information from the DocItem object, such as the code type, name, content, and whether it has a return value. It also checks if the code item is referenced by other objects or references other objects in the project.

Next, the function uses the ProjectManager instance to build the hierarchical structure of the project based on the who_reference_me and reference_who lists, as well as the doc_item_path. This structure represents the relationships between different objects in the project. The project_structure is a string representation of the hierarchical structure, with the current object marked with an asterisk (*).

The function then defines helper functions to retrieve the code and documentation of the objects that reference or are referenced by the current code item. These functions iterate over the reference_who and who_reference_me lists, respectively, and generate prompts containing the object's name, documentation, and raw code. These prompts are then included in the final documentation.

The function also includes a helper function to describe the relationship between the current code item and its callers and callees in the project. This description is based on whether there are objects that reference or are referenced by the current code item.

The function then constructs the main prompt, which includes information about the code item, its type, name, content, and whether it has a return value. It also includes prompts about the referenced and referencer objects, the hierarchical structure of the project, and the relationship between the current code item and its callers and callees.

After constructing the prompt, the function checks the total number of tokens in the prompt and the maximum input length allowed by the model. If the total tokens exceed the limit, the function tries to use a larger model or reduce the input length by removing certain parts of the prompt. If the total tokens are within the limit, the function sends a request to the chat completion model to generate the documentation.

Finally, the function returns the response message, which contains the generated documentation for the code item.

**Note**:
- Developers can use the generate_doc function to automatically generate documentation for code items in the project.
- The function utilizes the ProjectManager instance to build the hierarchical structure of the project and retrieve information about the relationships between objects.
- The generated documentation includes information about the code item, its type, name, content, and whether it has a return value.
- The documentation also includes prompts about the referenced and referencer objects,
#### FunctionDef get_referenced_prompt(doc_item)
