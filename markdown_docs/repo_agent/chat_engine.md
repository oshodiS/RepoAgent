## FunctionDef get_import_statements
**get_import_statements**: The function of get_import_statements is to extract import statements from the source code of the current module.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The get_import_statements function utilizes the inspect module to retrieve the source code lines of the current module. It then filters out lines that start with "import" or "from" and stores them in a list. Finally, it returns the list of import statements found in the source code.

**Note**: This function is useful for analyzing the dependencies of a module by extracting the import statements used within the code.

**Output Example**: 
['import sys', 'import inspect']
## ClassDef ResponseMessage
**ResponseMessage**: The function of ResponseMessage is to store a string content.

**attributes**: 
- content: a string that represents the content of the response message.

**Code Description**: 
The ResponseMessage class defines an object that holds a string content representing a response message. This class has one attribute:
- content: This attribute stores the actual text content of the response message.

The class is utilized within the project in the `attempt_generate_response` method of the `ChatEngine` class. In this method, instances of ResponseMessage are created to handle different scenarios during the generation of a response. If an unknown error occurs while attempting to generate a response, a ResponseMessage object is instantiated with a specific error message.

The ResponseMessage class serves as a simple container for response messages within the project, allowing for easy management and retrieval of response content.

**Note**: 
Developers can utilize the ResponseMessage class to encapsulate and manage response messages efficiently within the project.
## ClassDef ChatEngine
**ChatEngine**: The function of ChatEngine is to generate the documentation of functions or classes.

**attributes**:
- `project_manager`: The project manager object that handles the project hierarchy.

**Code Description**:
The ChatEngine class is responsible for generating documentation for functions or classes. It contains several methods that facilitate the generation of documentation.

The `num_tokens_from_string` method takes a text string as input and returns the number of tokens in the string. It uses the `tiktoken` library to encode the string and then calculates the length of the encoded tokens.

The `reduce_input_length` method is used to shorten the length of input prompts by modifying the `sys_prompt` contents. It takes two parameters, `shorten_attempt` and `prompt_data`. The method first logs the attempt number to reduce the length of the messages. If it is the first attempt, it removes the `project_structure` and `project_structure_prefix` from the `prompt_data`. If it is the second attempt, it further removes the caller and callee (reference) information from the `prompt_data`. Finally, it updates the `sys_prompt` with the modified `prompt_data` and returns it.

The `generate_response` method generates a response message using the OpenAI API. It takes four parameters: `model`, `sys_prompt`, `usr_prompt`, and `max_tokens`. It creates a list of messages containing the system prompt and user prompt. It then sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a completion based on the model, messages, temperature, and max tokens. The response message is extracted from the API response and returned.

The `attempt_generate_response` method attempts to generate a response message using the `generate_response` method. It takes five parameters: `model`, `sys_prompt`, `usr_prompt`, `max_tokens`, and `max_attempts`. It tries to generate a response message using the `generate_response` method. If the response message is None, it retries the request after a delay. If there is a connection error, it logs the error and retries after a delay. If there is an unknown error, it logs the error and retries after a longer delay. After a maximum number of attempts, it raises an exception or returns a default response message.

The `generate_doc` method generates the documentation for a given `doc_item`. It takes two parameters: `doc_item` and `file_handler`. It extracts the code information from the `doc_item` and determines if the code is referenced by other objects. It then constructs the initial prompt data with the relevant information. If the total tokens exceed the model's input limit, it tries to find a larger model or shorten the input length. If successful, it sends a request to generate the documentation using the `attempt_generate_response` method. The response message is returned.

**Note**: The ChatEngine class is an essential component of the documentation generation process. It provides methods to calculate the number of tokens in a string, reduce the length of input prompts, generate a response message using the OpenAI API, and handle errors during the generation process. It works in conjunction with other classes and functions to generate comprehensive and accurate documentation for functions or classes in a project.

**Output Example**: Mock up a possible appearance of the code's return value.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, project_manager)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ChatEngine object with a project_manager parameter.

**parameters**:
- project_manager: Represents the project manager object that will be assigned to the ChatEngine.

**Code Description**:
In this function, the project_manager parameter is assigned to the ChatEngine object's project_manager attribute. This allows the ChatEngine object to interact with the specified project manager during its operation.

**Note**:
It is essential to provide a valid project_manager object when initializing a ChatEngine instance to ensure proper functionality and communication with the project manager.
***
### FunctionDef num_tokens_from_string(self, string, encoding_name)
**num_tokens_from_string**: The function of num_tokens_from_string is to return the number of tokens in a text string.

**parameters**: 
- string: A string representing the text for which the number of tokens needs to be calculated.
- encoding_name: A string specifying the encoding name to be used for tokenization. It defaults to "cl100k_base".

**Code Description**: 
The num_tokens_from_string function takes a text string and an optional encoding name as input. It then retrieves the encoding based on the provided encoding name, tokenizes the input string using the encoding, and finally returns the number of tokens in the tokenized string.

**Note**: 
Ensure that the input string is in a format compatible with the specified encoding for accurate tokenization results.

**Output Example**: 
If the input string "Hello, world!" is passed to the function, and the default encoding "cl100k_base" is used for tokenization, the function will return 3 as the output, indicating that there are 3 tokens in the input string after tokenization.
***
### FunctionDef reduce_input_length(self, shorten_attempt, prompt_data)
**reduce_input_length**: The function of reduce_input_length is to reduce the length of the input prompts by modifying the sys_prompt contents.

**parameters**:
- shorten_attempt: An integer representing the attempt number to shorten the input prompts.
- prompt_data: Data structure containing information about the prompt.

**Code Description**:
The reduce_input_length function is responsible for adjusting the length of input prompts by altering the sys_prompt contents based on the shorten_attempt value. It first logs the attempt number to reduce the length of the messages. Depending on the shorten_attempt value, it modifies the prompt_data structure to adjust the prompt content accordingly. Finally, it updates the sys_prompt by formatting it with the modified prompt_data and returns the updated sys_prompt.

This function is called within the generate_doc method of the ChatEngine class in the chat_engine.py file. It is utilized to handle input prompt length reduction before generating a response based on the input data.

**Note**:
Ensure that the shorten_attempt parameter is either 0 or 1 to control the specific modifications applied to the prompt_data structure.

**Output Example**:
A possible appearance of the code's return value after reducing the input prompt length.
***
### FunctionDef generate_response(self, model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, max_tokens)
**generate_response**: The function of generate_response is to interact with the OpenAI API to generate a response based on the provided model, system prompt, user prompt, and maximum tokens.

**parameters**:
- model: The model used for generating the response.
- sys_prompt: The system prompt to provide context for the response.
- usr_prompt: The user prompt to provide additional context for the response.
- max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

**Code Description**:
The `generate_response` function initializes an OpenAI client with the provided API key, base URL, and timeout settings. It then creates a list of messages containing system and user prompts. The function sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a completion based on the model, messages, temperature, and max_tokens. Finally, it extracts the response message from the API response and returns it.

In the calling object `attempt_generate_response`, the `generate_response` function is utilized within a loop to attempt generating a response multiple times in case of errors. If the response message is None, the function continues to the next attempt. It handles API connection errors by logging the error, waiting for a specified time, and retrying the request. For other exceptions, it logs the error, waits for a different time, and retries. If the maximum number of attempts is reached, it either raises an exception or returns a predefined response message.

**Note**:
- Ensure the correct API key, base URL, and timeout settings are provided for successful interaction with the OpenAI API.
- Handle exceptions and retries appropriately to improve the robustness of response generation.

**Output Example**:
"A generated response message based on the provided prompts and model."
***
### FunctionDef attempt_generate_response(self, model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, max_tokens, max_attempts)
**attempt_generate_response**: The function of attempt_generate_response is to attempt generating a response by calling the generate_response function multiple times in case of errors. It handles API connection errors and other exceptions by logging the errors, waiting for a specified time, and retrying the request. If the maximum number of attempts is reached, it either raises an exception or returns a predefined response message.

**parameters**:
- model: The model used for generating the response.
- sys_prompt: The system prompt to provide context for the response.
- usr_prompt: The user prompt to provide additional context for the response.
- max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.
- max_attempts: The maximum number of attempts to generate a response. Default is 5.

**Code Description**:
The `attempt_generate_response` function is a method of the `ChatEngine` class in the `chat_engine.py` module. It is responsible for attempting to generate a response by calling the `generate_response` function multiple times in case of errors.

The function starts by initializing the `attempt` variable to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues until the `attempt` variable reaches the `max_attempts` value.

Within the loop, the function calls the `generate_response` function with the provided `model`, `sys_prompt`, `usr_prompt`, and `max_tokens` parameters. The response message is stored in the `response_message` variable.

If the `response_message` is None, indicating an unsuccessful response generation, the `attempt` variable is incremented by 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration.

If the `response_message` is not None, indicating a successful response generation, the function immediately returns the `response_message`.

If an `APIConnectionError` exception is raised during the `generate_response` function call, the error is logged using the `logger.error` method. The error message includes the specific error and the current attempt number out of the maximum attempts. The function then waits for 7 seconds using the `time.sleep` method and increments the `attempt` variable by 1. If the `attempt` variable reaches the `max_attempts` value, the exception is raised. Otherwise, the loop continues to the next iteration.

If any other exception is raised during the `generate_response` function call, the error is logged using the `logger.error` method. The error message includes the specific error and the current attempt number out of the maximum attempts. The function then waits for 10 seconds using the `time.sleep` method and increments the `attempt` variable by 1. If the `attempt` variable reaches the `max_attempts` value, a predefined response message is created using the `ResponseMessage` class with an error message indicating an unknown error occurred while generating the documentation. The function returns this response message.

**Note**:
- Developers should ensure the correct API key, base URL, and timeout settings are provided for successful interaction with the OpenAI API.
- Proper exception handling and retry mechanisms should be implemented to improve the robustness of response generation.
- The `max_attempts` parameter can be adjusted to control the number of attempts made to generate a response.
- The `attempt_generate_response` function is called within the project's `ChatEngine` class to handle response generation attempts.

**Output Example**:
"A generated response message based on the provided prompts and model."
***
### FunctionDef generate_doc(self, doc_item, file_handler)
**generate_doc**: The function of generate_doc is to generate documentation for a given object. It takes a `DocItem` object, which contains information about the code, and a `file_handler` object, which provides access to the project's files. The function retrieves the necessary information from the `DocItem` object, such as the code type, name, content, and whether it has a return value. It also checks if the code is referenced by other objects or if it references other objects.

The function then uses the `ProjectManager` instance to build the hierarchical structure of the project, including the object's position in the structure. It also retrieves information about the objects that reference the code and the objects that are referenced by the code.

Next, the function prepares prompts for the OpenAI chat model by combining the relevant information, such as the code type, name, content, and references. It also handles cases where the total number of tokens in the prompts exceeds the model's limit by either trying a larger model or reducing the input length.

Once the prompts are prepared, the function sends a request to the chat model to generate the documentation. It handles potential errors, such as API connection errors, by logging the errors, waiting for a specified time, and retrying the request. If the maximum number of attempts is reached without a successful response, the function either raises an exception or returns a predefined response message.

The generated documentation is then returned as a response message. If the code is referenced by other objects, the function includes information about the objects that reference it and their corresponding code and documentation. Similarly, if the code references other objects, the function includes information about the objects that are referenced and their corresponding code and documentation. The function also provides a possible appearance of the code's return value as an output example.

It is important to note that the `generate_doc` function relies on the `ChatEngine` class and the `ResponseMessage` class to handle the generation of the documentation and the storage of response messages, respectively.

Developers can utilize the `generate_doc` function to automatically generate documentation for code objects in their projects. By providing the necessary information and utilizing the OpenAI chat model, the function can generate detailed and accurate documentation, including information about references and return values.

Note: The `generate_doc` function may encounter limitations in processing code that exceeds the model's token limit. In such cases, the function attempts to use larger models or reduce the input length to generate the documentation. However, if the code itself is too long to process, the function returns a predefined response message indicating the limitation.
#### FunctionDef get_referenced_prompt(doc_item)
**get_referenced_prompt**: The function of get_referenced_prompt is to generate a prompt detailing the objects referenced by a given DocItem, including their code snippets and documentation.

**parameters**:
- doc_item: A DocItem object representing the item for which the referenced prompt is generated.

**Code Description**:
The get_referenced_prompt function iterates through the referenced objects of the input DocItem and constructs a prompt for each referenced object. It includes the object's full name, documentation content, and raw code snippet. The function appends each prompt to a list and returns the concatenated prompts as a single string.

The function first checks if there are any referenced objects. If there are, it constructs a prompt for each referenced object by extracting the object's full name, documentation content (if available), and raw code snippet. The prompt is formatted with the object's full name, followed by the documentation content (or 'None' if not available), and the raw code snippet enclosed in triple backticks.

The prompts for all referenced objects are collected in a list, and the function joins these prompts with newline characters to create the final prompt string, which is then returned.

**Note**: 
- This function provides a structured overview of the objects referenced by a given DocItem, aiding in understanding the relationships between different elements in the project.

**get_referencer_prompt**: The function of get_referencer_prompt is to generate a prompt detailing the objects that reference a given DocItem object, including their code snippets and documentation.

**parameters**: 
- doc_item: A DocItem object for which the referencing objects prompt is generated.

**Code Description**: 
The get_referencer_prompt function constructs a prompt that lists the objects referencing a specific DocItem object. It first checks if there are any referencing objects. If there are, it iterates through each referencing object and creates a formatted prompt for each. 

For each referencing object, the function includes the object's name, documentation, and code snippet in the prompt. If the referencing object has documentation available, it includes the last entry from the documentation. If the referencing object has code content available, it includes the code snippet. 

The function then joins all the individual prompts into a single formatted string and returns it as the final prompt.

**Note**: 
- The function returns an empty string if there are no referencing objects for the given DocItem.
- The prompt generated provides insights into the objects that reference the input DocItem, aiding in understanding the relationships within the codebase.
