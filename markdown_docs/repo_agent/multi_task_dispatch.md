## ClassDef Task
**Task**: The function of Task is to represent a task with a task ID, dependencies, extra information, and status.

**attributes**:
- task_id: An integer representing the task ID.
- dependencies: A list of Task objects representing the tasks that the current task depends on.
- extra_info: Additional information associated with the task. It defaults to None.
- status: An integer representing the status of the task (0 for not started, 1 for in progress, 2 for completed, 3 for error).

**Code Description**:
The Task class is designed to encapsulate information about a task within a system. It contains attributes such as task_id, dependencies, extra_info, and status to manage the task effectively. The task_id is an integer that uniquely identifies the task. The dependencies attribute is a list of Task objects that the current task depends on. The extra_info attribute can hold any additional information related to the task, with a default value of None. The status attribute indicates the current status of the task, with values 0, 1, 2, or 3 representing different states of the task.

In the project, the Task class is utilized within the TaskManager class in multi_task_dispatch.py. The TaskManager class uses the Task objects to manage tasks, add new tasks with dependencies, and maintain a dictionary mapping task IDs to Task objects.

**Note**:
- When creating a new Task object, ensure to provide the task_id, dependencies (as a list of Task objects), and any extra information if needed.
- The status attribute can be used to track the progress and completion status of the task.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, task_id, dependencies, extra_info)

**Code Description**: TaskManager class provides methods to add tasks with dependencies, retrieve the next available task for a process, mark tasks as completed, and manage task dependencies. The class initializes with an empty task dictionary, a lock for thread synchronization, and placeholders for task IDs and a synchronization function. The `add_task` method adds a new task to the dictionary with specified dependencies. The `get_next_task` method retrieves the next available task for a process, considering dependencies and task status. The `mark_completed` method marks a task as completed and removes it from the task dictionary.

In the project, the `get_task_manager` method in the `MetaInfo` class utilizes the TaskManager class to manage tasks based on the topology of objects in the repository. It adds tasks with dependencies, tracks task completion, and ensures proper task sequencing based on dependencies. The `get_topology` method in the same class calculates the topological order of all objects in the repository using the TaskManager for task management.

**Note**: Ensure proper synchronization when accessing and modifying tasks in a multi-threaded environment.

**Output Example**:
```python
task_manager = TaskManager()
task_id = task_manager.add_task(dependency_task_id=[1, 2], extra="additional info")
next_task, task_id = task_manager.get_next_task(process_id=1)
task_manager.mark_completed(task_id)
```
