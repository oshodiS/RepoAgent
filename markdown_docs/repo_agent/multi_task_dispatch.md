## ClassDef Task
**Task**: The function of Task is to represent a task with a task ID, dependencies, extra information, and status.

**attributes**: 
- task_id: An integer representing the ID of the task.
- dependencies: A list of Task objects representing the tasks that the current task depends on.
- extra_info: Any additional information associated with the task. It defaults to None.
- status: An integer representing the status of the task (0 for not started, 1 for in progress, 2 for completed, 3 for error).

**Code Description**: 
The Task class is designed to encapsulate the details of a task within a multi-task dispatch system. Each Task object is initialized with a task ID, a list of dependencies, optional extra information, and a status indicator. The task ID uniquely identifies the task, while the dependencies attribute holds references to other Task objects that this task depends on. The extra_info parameter allows for attaching additional details to the task. The status attribute tracks the current state of the task, with values indicating whether it has not started, is in progress, has been completed, or encountered an error.

In the project, the Task class is utilized within the TaskManager class of the multi_task_dispatch module. When tasks are added to the task dictionary using the add_task method, instances of the Task class are created with the provided task ID, dependencies, and extra information. This class plays a crucial role in managing and executing tasks within the multi-task dispatch system.

**Note**: 
Developers can leverage the Task class to define and manage individual tasks within a larger task management system. By setting dependencies and tracking the status of tasks, users can orchestrate complex workflows and ensure tasks are executed in the correct order.
