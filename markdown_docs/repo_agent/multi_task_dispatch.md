## ClassDef Task
**Task**: The function of Task is to represent a task with a task ID, dependencies, extra information, and status.

**attributes**:
- task_id: An integer representing the task ID.
- dependencies: A list of Task objects that the current task depends on.
- extra_info: Additional information associated with the task.
- status: An integer indicating the status of the task (0 for not started, 1 for in progress, 2 for completed, 3 for error).

**Code Description**:
The Task class is designed to encapsulate information about a task in a multi-task dispatch system. Each Task object is initialized with a task ID, a list of dependencies (other Task objects), optional extra information, and an initial status of 0 (not started).

The task_id attribute uniquely identifies each task, while dependencies store a list of Task objects that the current task relies on before it can be executed. The extra_info attribute can hold any additional information related to the task. The status attribute tracks the progress of the task, with values indicating whether it has started, is in progress, has been completed, or has encountered an error.

In the project, the Task class is utilized within the TaskManager class of the multi_task_dispatch module. The TaskManager class manages a dictionary mapping task IDs to Task objects and provides methods for adding tasks with dependencies.

When a new task is added using the add_task method of TaskManager, a new Task object is created with the provided dependencies and extra information. This allows for the dynamic creation and management of tasks within the multi-task dispatch system.

**Note**:
Developers can use the Task class to define and track individual tasks within a larger task management system. By setting dependencies and extra information, tasks can be organized and executed based on their relationships and associated details.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, task_id, dependencies, extra_info)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a Task object with the provided task ID, dependencies, and extra information.

**parameters**:
- task_id: An integer representing the unique identifier of the task.
- dependencies: A list of Task objects that this task depends on.
- extra_info: Any additional information related to the task (default is None).

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes a Task object with the given task_id, dependencies, and extra_info. It sets the task status to 0, indicating that the task has not started yet. The task status can be updated to 1 (in progress), 2 (completed), or 3 (error).

**Note**:
- Make sure to provide a valid task_id and dependencies when creating a Task object.
- The extra_info parameter is optional and can be used to store any additional information related to the task.

## ClassDef TaskManager
**TaskManager**: The function of TaskManager is to manage tasks by adding, retrieving, marking as completed, and maintaining task dependencies.

**attributes**:
- task_dict (Dict[int, Task]): A dictionary that maps task IDs to Task objects.
- task_lock (threading.Lock): A lock used for thread synchronization when accessing the task_dict.
- now_id (int): The current task ID.
- query_id (int): The current query ID.
- sync_func (None): A placeholder for a synchronization function.

**Code Description**: TaskManager class provides methods to add tasks with dependencies, retrieve the next task for a process, mark tasks as completed, and manage task dependencies. The class initializes with an empty task dictionary, a task lock for synchronization, and placeholders for task IDs and a synchronization function. The `add_task` method adds a new task to the dictionary with specified dependencies. The `get_next_task` method retrieves the next available task for a process, considering dependencies and task status. The `mark_completed` method marks a task as completed and removes it from the task dictionary.

In the project, the `get_task_manager` method in the `MetaInfo` class utilizes the TaskManager to manage tasks based on the provided task_available_func. It iterates through document items, handles task dependencies, and adds tasks to the TaskManager. The `get_topology` method in the same class calculates the topological order of objects in the repository using the TaskManager.

**Note**: Ensure proper synchronization when accessing the task dictionary to avoid race conditions.

**Output Example**:
```python
task_manager = TaskManager()
task_id = task_manager.add_task(dependency_task_id=[1, 2], extra="Additional information")
next_task, task_id = task_manager.get_next_task(process_id=1)
task_manager.mark_completed(task_id)
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a MultiTaskDispatch object with specific attributes.

**parameters**:
- No external parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes a MultiTaskDispatch object by setting up the necessary attributes. It creates a task_dict, which is a dictionary mapping task IDs to Task objects, a task_lock for thread synchronization, and initializes now_id and query_id to 0. Additionally, it sets up a sync_func as a placeholder for a synchronization function.

The task_dict attribute stores Task objects with their corresponding task IDs, allowing for efficient task management. The task_lock attribute is used for thread synchronization when accessing the task_dict to prevent race conditions in a multi-threaded environment. The now_id and query_id attributes keep track of the current task ID and query ID, respectively. The sync_func attribute serves as a placeholder for a synchronization function that can be assigned later.

The initialization of these attributes ensures that the MultiTaskDispatch object is properly configured to handle tasks and synchronization within a multi-task dispatch system.

**Note**:
Developers utilizing the MultiTaskDispatch object should ensure proper handling of thread synchronization using the task_lock attribute to prevent data inconsistencies. The task_dict attribute provides a centralized storage for Task objects, enabling efficient task management and tracking.

## FunctionDef some_function
**some_function**: The function of some_function is to randomly sleep for a short period of time.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**: 
The some_function utilizes the time.sleep() function along with the random.random() method to introduce a random delay in the execution of the code. The random.random() * 3 generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 3, which is then used as the argument for the time.sleep() function. This causes the function to pause for a random duration before continuing with the rest of the code execution.

**Note**: 
Developers using this function should be aware that it introduces a random delay in the program flow, which can be useful for simulating real-world scenarios or adding variability to the execution timeline.
