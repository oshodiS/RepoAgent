## ClassDef ProjectManager
**ProjectManager**: The function of ProjectManager is to manage project-related operations such as retrieving the project structure and building a path tree.

**attributes**:
- repo_path: The path to the repository.
- project: An instance of the jedi.Project class.
- project_hierarchy: The path to the project hierarchy JSON file.

**Code Description**:
The ProjectManager class initializes with the repository path and project hierarchy. It provides methods to get the project structure by walking through the directory tree and build a path tree based on references and document item paths. The get_project_structure method recursively walks through the directory tree and returns the project structure as a string. The build_path_tree method constructs a tree based on references and document item paths.

In the calling situation in the project, the Runner class initializes the ProjectManager instance with the repository path and project hierarchy. It also interacts with other components such as ChangeDetector, ChatEngine, MetaInfo, Summarizator, and more for project management and documentation tasks.

**Note**:
- Ensure the repo_path and project_hierarchy are correctly set before using the ProjectManager methods.
- The build_path_tree method requires proper inputs to generate the path tree accurately.

**Output Example**:
```
src
  main.py
  utils.py
tests
  test_main.py
docs
  README.md
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, repo_path, project_hierarchy)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ProjectManager object with the provided repo_path and project_hierarchy.

**parameters**:
- repo_path: The path to the repository.
- project_hierarchy: The hierarchy of the project within the repository.

**Code Description**:
In this function, the repo_path and project_hierarchy are assigned to the respective attributes of the ProjectManager object. Additionally, a new jedi Project is created using the repo_path. The project_hierarchy attribute is set to the path of the project_hierarchy.json file within the specified project_hierarchy directory.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the repo_path and project_hierarchy are valid paths before initializing the ProjectManager object.
- Make sure that the necessary dependencies like jedi and os are imported before using this function.

### FunctionDef get_project_structure(self)
**get_project_structure**: The function of get_project_structure is to retrieve the structure of the project by recursively traversing the directory tree.

**parameters**:
- self: The reference to the current instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**:
The get_project_structure function starts by defining a nested function called walk_dir, which recursively walks through the directory tree and constructs the project structure. It ignores hidden files and directories (those starting with a dot) and only includes Python files (.py) in the structure. The function then returns the project structure as a string.

**Note**:
- Make sure to provide the correct repo_path attribute to the ProjectManager instance before calling get_project_structure.
- Ensure that the directory structure is accessible and readable by the script.

**Output Example**:
```
project_folder
  subfolder1
    file1.py
    file2.py
  subfolder2
    file3.py
```
#### FunctionDef walk_dir(root, prefix)
**walk_dir**: The function of walk_dir is to recursively walk through a directory structure, ignoring hidden files and directories, and collecting Python files.

**parameters**:
· root: The root directory to start walking from.
· prefix: A string representing the current indentation level in the directory structure.

**Code Description**:
The walk_dir function takes two parameters, root, and prefix. It appends the base name of the current directory to the structure list after applying the provided prefix. Then, it iterates over the sorted list of items in the current directory. If an item starts with a ".", it is skipped to ignore hidden files and directories. For each item, it constructs the full path and checks if it is a directory or a Python file (.py extension). If it is a directory, the function is called recursively with the new path and an increased indentation level. If it is a Python file, the file name is appended to the structure list with the updated indentation level.

**Note**:
- This function is useful for traversing directory structures and collecting specific types of files, such as Python files.
- Ensure that the root parameter is a valid directory path.

### FunctionDef build_path_tree(self, who_reference_me, reference_who, doc_item_path)
**build_path_tree**: The function of build_path_tree is to construct a tree structure based on the provided paths and return a string representation of the tree.

**parameters**:
- who_reference_me: List of paths referencing the current object.
- reference_who: List of paths referenced by the current object.
- doc_item_path: Path of the document item.

**Code Description**: The build_path_tree function initializes a tree structure using defaultdict. It then iterates over the paths in who_reference_me and reference_who lists, splitting each path by the separator and creating nested nodes in the tree accordingly. After processing the doc_item_path by splitting it and marking the last part with a specific symbol, the function generates a string representation of the tree using a recursive tree_to_string function.

**Note**: This function is essential for organizing and visualizing the relationships between different paths in the project's hierarchy. It helps in understanding the dependencies and connections between various components.

**Output Example**: 
```
    repo_agent
        project_manager.py
            ProjectManager
                ✳️build_path_tree
```
#### FunctionDef tree
**tree**: The function of tree is to create a defaultdict with nested tree structures.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are required for this function.

**Code Description**: 
The tree function returns a defaultdict with the default_factory set to tree. This allows the creation of nested tree structures where new keys automatically create new defaultdict instances.

**Note**: 
When using this function, keep in mind that the nested tree structure can be accessed and modified using standard dictionary methods.

**Output Example**: 
A possible appearance of the return value:
defaultdict(<function tree at 0x000001>, {})
***
#### FunctionDef tree_to_string(tree, indent)
**tree_to_string**: The function of tree_to_string is to convert a nested dictionary representing a tree structure into a string with proper indentation.

**parameters**:
- tree: A nested dictionary representing a tree structure.
- indent: An integer representing the current level of indentation (default is 0).

**Code Description**:
The tree_to_string function takes a nested dictionary 'tree' and an optional 'indent' parameter. It iterates through the items of the dictionary in sorted order, adding each key to the string with the appropriate level of indentation. If the corresponding value of a key is another dictionary, the function recursively calls itself with the nested dictionary and increments the indentation level. The function then returns the resulting string representation of the tree.

**Note**:
- Make sure to provide a valid nested dictionary as input to the function to get the desired output.
- The function uses recursion to handle nested dictionaries, so ensure that the depth of the tree is within the recursion limit to avoid potential stack overflow errors.

**Output Example**:
```
root
    ├── child1
    │   ├── subchild1
    │   └── subchild2
    └── child2
```
