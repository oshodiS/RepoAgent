## ClassDef ProjectManager
**ProjectManager**: The function of ProjectManager is to manage the project structure and paths within a repository.

**attributes**:
- repo_path: The path to the repository.
- project: An instance of the jedi.Project class initialized with the repo_path.
- project_hierarchy: The path to the project hierarchy JSON file.

**Code Description**:
The ProjectManager class provides methods to retrieve the project structure and build a path tree based on references within the project. The `get_project_structure` method recursively walks through the directory tree and returns the project structure as a string. The `build_path_tree` method constructs a tree representing references within the project and a specified document item path.

The `build_path_tree` method utilizes nested dictionaries to represent the path tree structure. It processes the references of `who_reference_me` and `reference_who`, then handles the `doc_item_path` by marking the last object with a star symbol. The method converts the tree structure into a string format for easier visualization.

In the project, the ProjectManager is instantiated in the Runner class to manage the project structure, detect changes, and interact with the ChatEngine and MetaInfo classes. It plays a crucial role in handling project-related operations and maintaining the project's integrity.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize the ProjectManager class to efficiently manage project structures and paths within a repository. Understanding the methods provided by the class can help in navigating and analyzing project dependencies effectively.

**Output Example**:
```
    project_folder
        subfolder1
          file1.py
          file2.py
        subfolder2
          file3.py
    main.py
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, repo_path, project_hierarchy)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ProjectManager object with the provided repo_path and project_hierarchy.

**parameters**:
- repo_path: The path to the repository.
- project_hierarchy: The hierarchy of the project within the repository.

**Code Description**:
In the __init__ function, the provided repo_path is assigned to self.repo_path. Then, a jedi Project is created using the repo_path and assigned to self.project. Additionally, the project_hierarchy path is constructed by joining repo_path, project_hierarchy, and "project_hierarchy.json", and assigned to self.project_hierarchy.

**Note**:
- This function sets up the ProjectManager object with the necessary repository path and project hierarchy information for further operations.
***
### FunctionDef get_project_structure(self)
**get_project_structure**: The function of get_project_structure is to return the structure of the project by recursively walking through the directory tree.

**parameters**:
- No external parameters are required for this function.

**Code Description**:
The get_project_structure function starts by defining a nested function called walk_dir, which recursively walks through the directory tree starting from the specified root directory. It appends the directory names and Python files (.py) found in the project structure to a list called structure. The function ignores hidden files and directories (those starting with a dot). Finally, it returns the project structure as a string by joining the elements of the structure list with newline characters.

**Note**:
- This function relies on the os module to interact with the file system, so make sure the necessary permissions are granted.
- Ensure that the repo_path attribute of the object points to the root directory of the project before calling this function.

**Output Example**:
```
project_folder
  subfolder1
    file1.py
    file2.py
  subfolder2
    file3.py
```
#### FunctionDef walk_dir(root, prefix)
**walk_dir**: The function of walk_dir is to recursively traverse a directory structure, ignoring hidden files and directories, and appending the names of Python files to a list.

**parameters**:
· root: The root directory to start the traversal from.
· prefix: A string representing the current indentation level in the directory structure.

**Code Description**:
The walk_dir function takes two parameters: root and prefix. It appends the base name of the root directory to the 'structure' list after applying the current prefix. It then iterates over the sorted list of items in the root directory. If an item starts with a ".", it is skipped to ignore hidden files and directories. For each item, it constructs the full path and checks if it is a directory or a Python file. If it is a directory, the function is recursively called with the new path and an updated prefix. If it is a Python file, the file name is appended to the 'structure' list with the updated prefix.

**Note**:
- This function is useful for generating a structured representation of a directory tree, particularly for Python files.
- Ensure that the 'structure' list is defined and accessible in the scope where the walk_dir function is called.

### FunctionDef build_path_tree(self, who_reference_me, reference_who, doc_item_path)
**build_path_tree**: The function of build_path_tree is to construct a tree data structure based on the provided paths and return a string representation of the tree.

**parameters**:
- who_reference_me: List of paths referencing the current object.
- reference_who: List of paths referenced by the current object.
- doc_item_path: Path of the document item.

**Code Description**:
The function first initializes a tree structure using defaultdict. It then iterates through the paths in who_reference_me and reference_who lists to build a tree structure representing the relationships between the paths. Additionally, it processes the doc_item_path by splitting it into parts, marking the last part with a special symbol, and adding it to the tree structure. Finally, it converts the tree structure into a string representation recursively.

This function is called within the ChatEngine class to generate documentation for a specific code item. It is used to build a hierarchical path tree structure based on the referencing and referenced paths, which is essential for understanding the relationships between different code elements in the project.

**Note**: Ensure that the paths provided are valid and correctly formatted to generate an accurate tree structure.

**Output Example**: 
```
root
    folder1
        subfolder1
            ✳️file1
        subfolder2
            ✳️file2
    folder2
        ✳️file3
```
#### FunctionDef tree
**tree**: The function of tree is to create a defaultdict with the ability to nest dictionaries infinitely.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The tree function utilizes the defaultdict class from the collections module to create a nested dictionary structure that can be extended indefinitely. By calling defaultdict(tree), each new key in the dictionary will automatically create a new nested dictionary, allowing for a flexible and dynamic data structure.

**Note**: This function is useful for creating hierarchical data structures where the depth of nesting is not predetermined. It simplifies the process of working with nested dictionaries by automatically creating new levels as needed.

**Output Example**: 
{
    'key1': {
        'key2': {
            'key3': {}
        }
    }
}
***
#### FunctionDef tree_to_string(tree, indent)
**tree_to_string**: The function of tree_to_string is to convert a nested dictionary tree structure into a string representation with proper indentation.

**parameters**:
- tree: A nested dictionary representing the tree structure.
- indent: An integer representing the current level of indentation (default is 0).

**Code Description**:
The tree_to_string function takes a nested dictionary 'tree' and an optional 'indent' parameter to recursively iterate through the tree structure. It sorts the keys of the current level of the tree, appends each key to the string with the appropriate indentation, and then recursively calls itself if the corresponding value is another dictionary. This process continues until all levels of the tree have been traversed, and a string representation of the tree with proper indentation is constructed.

**Note**:
- Make sure to provide a valid nested dictionary as input to the function to avoid errors.
- The function uses recursion to handle nested structures, so be cautious with deeply nested trees to prevent stack overflow errors.

**Output Example**:
```
root
    ├── child1
    │   ├── subchild1
    │   └── subchild2
    └── child2
```
