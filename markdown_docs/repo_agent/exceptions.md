## ClassDef ErrorHandler
**ErrorHandler**: The function of ErrorHandler is to handle different types of exceptions and log appropriate messages based on the type of exception.

**attributes**:
- e: The exception object that needs to be handled.

**Code Description**:
The ErrorHandler class contains a static method called handle_exception, which takes an exception object as a parameter. The method checks the type of the exception and logs a specific message based on the type of exception. If the exception is an APIConnectionError, it logs a warning message using the logger. If the exception is an OpenAIError, it logs an error message. For any other type of exception, it logs a generic error message.

**Note**:
Developers can use the ErrorHandler class to centralize exception handling and logging in their codebase. It provides a structured way to handle different types of exceptions and ensures that appropriate messages are logged for each type of exception.
### FunctionDef handle_exception(e)
**handle_exception**: The function of handle_exception is to log different types of errors based on the type of exception received as input.

**parameters**:
- e: The exception object that is being handled.

**Code Description**:
The handle_exception function takes an exception object as input and checks its type. If the exception is an instance of APIConnectionError, a warning message is logged. If it is an instance of OpenAIError, an error message is logged. For any other type of exception, an error message indicating an unexpected error is logged.

The function utilizes the logger to record the error messages based on the type of exception received.

**Note**:
Developers can use this function to handle different types of exceptions and log appropriate error messages based on the exception type.
***
## ClassDef OpenAIError
**OpenAIError**: The function of OpenAIError is to define a custom exception class for OpenAI related errors.

**attributes**:
- message: A string that represents the error message.

**Code Description**:
The OpenAIError class is a custom exception class that inherits from the built-in Exception class. It is designed to handle errors specific to OpenAI operations. The class has an `__init__` method that takes a message parameter and passes it to the parent Exception class using the `super()` function.

In the project, the OpenAIError class is utilized in the ErrorHandler class to handle exceptions. In the `handle_exception` method of the ErrorHandler class, if an exception is an instance of OpenAIError, an error message is logged using a logger.

**Note**:
Developers can raise instances of the OpenAIError class to handle custom errors related to OpenAI operations.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the OpenAIError class with a message.

**parameters**:
- message: A string representing the error message.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a constructor method for the OpenAIError class. It takes in a message parameter, which is a string containing the error message. Inside the function, it calls the constructor of the superclass (parent class) using the super() function, passing the message parameter to initialize the error message.

**Note**:
- Make sure to provide a meaningful error message when initializing an instance of the OpenAIError class.
