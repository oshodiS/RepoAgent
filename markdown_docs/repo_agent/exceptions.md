## ClassDef ErrorHandler
**ErrorHandler**: The function of ErrorHandler is to handle different types of exceptions and log appropriate messages based on the type of exception.

**attributes**:
- e: The exception object that needs to be handled.

**Code Description**:
The ErrorHandler class contains a static method called handle_exception, which takes an exception object as a parameter. The method checks the type of the exception and logs a specific message based on the type of exception. If the exception is an APIConnectionError, it logs a warning message using the logger. If the exception is an OpenAIError, it logs an error message. For any other type of exception, it logs a generic error message.

**Note**:
Developers can use the ErrorHandler class to centralize exception handling logic in their codebase. It provides a structured way to handle different types of exceptions and log appropriate messages for each type.
### FunctionDef handle_exception(e)
**handle_exception**: The function of handle_exception is to handle different types of exceptions and log corresponding error messages based on the type of exception encountered.

**parameters**:
- e: The exception object that needs to be handled.

**Code Description**:
The handle_exception function takes an exception object as a parameter and checks the type of the exception. If the exception is an instance of APIConnectionError, it logs a warning message using the logger. If the exception is an instance of OpenAIError, it logs an error message. For any other type of exception, it logs a generic error message. This function is designed to provide specific error handling based on the type of exception encountered during the execution of the code.

The handle_exception function utilizes the OpenAIError class to handle OpenAI related exceptions. When an OpenAIError instance is encountered, the function logs an error message indicating the occurrence of an OpenAIError.

**Note**:
Developers can use the handle_exception function to centralize exception handling logic and provide customized error messages based on the type of exception, improving code readability and maintainability.
***
## ClassDef OpenAIError
**OpenAIError**: The function of OpenAIError is to define a custom error class for OpenAI related exceptions.

**attributes**:
- message: A string message to describe the error.

**Code Description**:
The OpenAIError class is a custom exception class that inherits from the built-in Exception class. It is designed to handle errors specific to OpenAI operations. The class has an `__init__` method that takes a message as a parameter and calls the parent class Exception's `__init__` method with the provided message.

In the project, the OpenAIError class is utilized within the ErrorHandler's `handle_exception` method. When an instance of OpenAIError is encountered, the logger logs an error message indicating that an OpenAIError has occurred.

**Note**:
Developers can raise instances of the OpenAIError class with custom error messages to handle OpenAI related exceptions in their code effectively.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the OpenAIError class with a message.

**parameters**:
- message: A string representing the error message.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a constructor method for the OpenAIError class. It takes a message parameter, which is a string containing the error message. Inside the function, it calls the constructor of the superclass (super()) to initialize the error message.

**Note**:
Make sure to provide a meaningful error message when initializing an instance of the OpenAIError class using this __init__ function.
