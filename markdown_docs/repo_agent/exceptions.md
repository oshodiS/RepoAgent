## ClassDef ErrorHandler
**ErrorHandler**: The function of ErrorHandler is to handle different types of exceptions and log appropriate messages based on the type of exception.

**attributes**:
- e: The exception object that needs to be handled.

**Code Description**:
The ErrorHandler class contains a static method called handle_exception, which takes an exception object as a parameter. The method checks the type of the exception and logs a specific message accordingly using a logger. If the exception is an APIConnectionError, a warning message is logged. If it is an OpenAIError, an error message is logged. For any other type of exception, an error message indicating an unexpected error is logged.

**Note**:
Developers can use the ErrorHandler class to centralize exception handling logic and provide consistent error messages across the application. It is important to ensure that the logger used in the class is properly configured to capture and store the log messages effectively.
### FunctionDef handle_exception(e)
**handle_exception**: The function of handle_exception is to handle different types of exceptions and log specific error messages based on the type of exception received.

**parameters**:
- e: The exception object that needs to be handled.

**Code Description**:
The handle_exception function takes an exception object as a parameter and checks if the exception is an instance of APIConnectionError or OpenAIError. If the exception is an APIConnectionError, a warning message is logged using a logger. If the exception is an OpenAIError, an error message is logged. For any other type of exception, an error message indicating an unexpected error is logged.

This function is part of the ErrorHandler class in the exceptions.py module. It is used to centralize exception handling logic and provide specific error messages for different types of exceptions that may occur during OpenAI operations.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize this function to handle exceptions gracefully and log informative error messages for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.
***
## ClassDef OpenAIError
**OpenAIError**: The function of OpenAIError is to define a custom error class for OpenAI-related exceptions.

**attributes**:
- message: A string that represents the error message.

**Code Description**:
The OpenAIError class is a custom exception class that inherits from the built-in Exception class. It is designed to handle errors specific to OpenAI operations. The class has a constructor method (__init__) that takes a message parameter to initialize the error message. When an instance of OpenAIError is raised, it calls the constructor of the parent Exception class with the provided message.

In the project, the OpenAIError class is utilized in the ErrorHandler class to handle exceptions. In the handle_exception method of the ErrorHandler class, different types of exceptions are checked, and if the exception is an instance of OpenAIError, a specific error message is logged using a logger.

**Note**:
Developers can raise instances of the OpenAIError class with custom error messages to handle OpenAI-related exceptions in their code effectively.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the OpenAIError class with a message.

**parameters**:
- message: A string representing the error message.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a constructor method for the OpenAIError class. It takes in a message parameter, which is a string containing the error message. Inside the function, it calls the superclass's (__init__) constructor method using super() to initialize the error message.

**Note**:
- Make sure to provide a meaningful error message when initializing an instance of the OpenAIError class.
