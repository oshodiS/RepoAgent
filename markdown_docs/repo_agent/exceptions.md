## ClassDef ErrorHandler
**ErrorHandler**: The function of ErrorHandler is to handle different types of exceptions and log appropriate messages based on the type of exception.

**attributes**:
- e: The exception object that needs to be handled.

**Code Description**:
The ErrorHandler class contains a static method called handle_exception, which takes an exception object as a parameter. The method checks the type of the exception and logs a specific message based on the type of the exception. If the exception is an APIConnectionError, a warning message is logged using the logger. If the exception is an OpenAIError, an error message is logged. For any other type of exception, an error message indicating an unexpected error is logged.

**Note**:
Developers can use the ErrorHandler class to centralize exception handling logic in their codebase. By calling the handle_exception method with the appropriate exception object, developers can ensure consistent and structured error logging throughout their application.
### FunctionDef handle_exception(e)
**handle_exception**: The function of handle_exception is to handle different types of exceptions based on their instance and log appropriate error messages using a logger.

**parameters**:
- e: The exception instance that needs to be handled.

**Code Description**:
The handle_exception function takes an exception instance as a parameter. It checks the type of the exception using isinstance() function to determine the specific type of exception (APIConnectionError or OpenAIError). Depending on the type of exception, it logs different error messages using a logger. If the exception is an instance of APIConnectionError, a warning message is logged. If it is an instance of OpenAIError, an error message is logged. For any other type of exception, an error message indicating an unexpected error is logged.

The function is designed to provide specific error handling for different types of exceptions that may occur during the execution of the code. By logging detailed error messages, developers can easily identify and troubleshoot issues in their code.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the error handling logic in the handle_exception function to suit their specific requirements. The function demonstrates a structured approach to handling exceptions and logging appropriate error messages based on the type of exception encountered.

## ClassDef OpenAIError
**OpenAIError**: The function of OpenAIError is to define a custom exception class for OpenAI related errors.

**attributes**:
- message: A string representing the error message.

**Code Description**:
The OpenAIError class is a custom exception class that inherits from the built-in Exception class. It is designed to handle errors specific to the OpenAI API. The class has a constructor method `__init__` that takes a message parameter and calls the constructor of the parent class Exception with the provided message.

In the project, the OpenAIError class is utilized in the ErrorHandler class within the handle_exception method. When an instance of OpenAIError is encountered, the logger logs an error message indicating that an OpenAIError has occurred.

**Note**:
Developers can raise instances of the OpenAIError class with a custom error message to handle OpenAI related errors in their code effectively.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, message)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the OpenAIError class with a message.

**parameters**:
- message: A string representing the error message to be associated with the OpenAIError instance.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function is a constructor method for the OpenAIError class. It takes a message parameter, which is a string containing the error message. Inside the function, it calls the constructor of the superclass (in this case, the parent class) using the super() function, passing the message parameter to initialize the error message associated with the OpenAIError instance.

**Note**:
- This function is used to create instances of the OpenAIError class with a specific error message.
