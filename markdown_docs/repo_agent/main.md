## FunctionDef language_prompt(default_language)
**language_prompt**: The function of language_prompt is to prompt the user to enter a language code or name and return the corresponding language name.

**parameters**:
- default_language: The default language code or name to be displayed in the prompt.

**Code Description**: 
The `language_prompt` function utilizes the `click.prompt` method to request the user to input a language code or name. It then attempts to match the input with a language name using the `Language.match` method. If a match is found, the function returns the language name. If no match is found, it raises a `LanguageNotFoundError` exception and displays an error message.

In the project, the `language_prompt` function is called within the `configure` function in order to set the language parameter for the agent's settings. By providing the default language from the existing project settings, it allows the user to either accept the default language or input a new one during the configuration process.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the input language code or name is valid to avoid errors.
- Handle the `LanguageNotFoundError` exception appropriately if it occurs.

**Output Example**: 
If the user enters 'en' as the language code, the function will return 'English'.
## FunctionDef cli

**Code Description**: 
The cli function is designed to be an LLM-Powered Framework for Repository-level Code Documentation Generation. However, the function itself does not contain any specific implementation details as it currently only includes a pass statement. It is intended to be further developed to provide functionalities related to generating documentation for code repositories.

**Note**: 
Developers can utilize this function as a starting point to build a more comprehensive code documentation generation tool within the repository agent project. The function's purpose is to leverage LLM (Large Language Models) to enhance the documentation generation process, providing a more efficient and accurate way to document code within a repository.
## FunctionDef configure
**configure**: The function of configure is to configure the agent's parameters.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are explicitly defined for this function.

**Code Description**:
The `configure` function is responsible for configuring the agent's parameters. It prompts the user to input various settings such as the target repository path, project hierarchy file name, Markdown documents folder name, ignore list, language, maximum number of threads, maximum number of document tokens, and log level.

The function first creates an instance of the `ProjectSettings` class, which represents the project-specific settings. It prompts the user to enter the target repository path, hierarchy file name, Markdown documents folder name, ignore list, language, maximum number of threads, maximum number of document tokens, and log level. The user can either provide their own values or accept the default values from the `project_settings_default_instance`.

Next, the function creates an instance of the `ChatCompletionSettings` class, which represents the chat completion settings. It prompts the user to enter the model, temperature, request timeout, and base URL. The user can either provide their own values or accept the default values from the `chat_completion_default_instance`.

After obtaining the project and chat completion settings, the function creates an instance of the `Setting` class, which combines both sets of settings. This instance is used to update the configuration file by calling the `write_config` function from the `config_manager.py` module.

Finally, the function logs a success message indicating that the project and chat completion settings have been saved successfully.

The `configure` function is called within the project to allow users to configure the agent's parameters before running the program. It ensures that the agent operates with the specified settings, providing flexibility and customization options to the user.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the user provides valid inputs for each parameter to avoid errors.
- The `write_config` function is responsible for updating the configuration file with the new settings. Refer to the documentation for the `write_config` function for more details on its functionality and usage.
## FunctionDef run(model, temperature, request_timeout, base_url, target_repo_path, hierarchy_path, markdown_docs_path, ignore_list, language, log_level)
**run**: The function of run is to execute the program with the specified parameters.

**parameters**:
- model: The model to be used for chat completion.
- temperature: The temperature for sampling.
- request_timeout: The timeout for API requests.
- base_url: The base URL for API requests.
- target_repo_path: The path to the target repository.
- hierarchy_path: The name of the project hierarchy file.
- markdown_docs_path: The name of the folder for Markdown documents.
- ignore_list: A list of files or directories to be ignored.
- language: The language setting for the project.
- log_level: The log level for logging.

**Code Description**:
The run function is the entry point for executing the program with the specified parameters. It first creates an instance of the ProjectSettings class, which encapsulates the project-specific settings such as the target repository path, project hierarchy name, Markdown documents folder name, ignore list, language, and log level. It also creates an instance of the ChatCompletionSettings class, which contains settings related to chat completion, including the model, temperature, request timeout, and base URL.

The function then creates an instance of the Setting class, which combines both the project settings and chat completion settings. It uses the project settings to initialize the ProjectSettings instance and the chat completion settings to initialize the ChatCompletionSettings instance.

Next, the function calls the write_config function from the config_manager module to update the existing configuration with the new values and write the updated configuration back to the file. This function is responsible for saving the project and chat completion settings to the configuration file.

After updating the configuration, the function calls the set_logger_level_from_config function from the log module to set the logger level for logging. This function removes the existing logger, adds a new logger with the specified log level, and intercepts standard logging messages, redirecting them to Loguru for processing. It sets the log level and displays a success message indicating the log level has been updated.

The function then creates an instance of the Runner class, which is responsible for generating and updating documentation for the target repository. It initializes various components such as the project manager, change detector, chat engine, and metadata information.

Finally, the function calls the run method of the Runner class to start the document update process. If the documents have not been generated yet, it calls the first_generate method to generate all the documents. If the documents have already been generated, it checks for changes in the target repository using the ChangeDetector. It then creates a task manager to manage the update tasks and uses multiple threads to update the documents concurrently. Once the update is complete, it updates the document version, saves the metadata, and refreshes the markdown documents.

**Note**:
- Developers can use the run function to execute the program with the specified parameters and generate or update the documentation for the target repository.
- Ensure that the provided parameters are valid and appropriate for the project.
- The run function relies on other functions and classes such as write_config, set_logger_level_from_config, and Runner to perform its tasks effectively.
## FunctionDef clean
**clean**: The function of clean is to clean the fake files generated by the documentation process.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The clean function calls the delete_fake_files function to remove all fake files created during the documentation process. Upon execution, delete_fake_files recursively traverses the target repository path, identifies fake files based on a specific substring, replaces the substring with ".py" in the file name, and performs file operations accordingly. After the cleanup process is completed, the clean function logs a success message confirming the removal of fake files.

The clean function plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the documentation process by ensuring that unnecessary fake files are eliminated before generating or updating documents. Additionally, the run function in runner.py also utilizes delete_fake_files to remove fake files as part of the document update process, contributing to the overall efficiency and accuracy of document management in the project.

**Note**: It is essential to utilize the clean function to eliminate fake files before document generation or update to uphold the reliability and accuracy of the documentation process.
## FunctionDef print_hierarchy
**print_hierarchy**: The function of print_hierarchy is to print the hierarchy of the target repository.

**parameters**:
- indent: An integer representing the level of indentation for the printed output.
- print_content: A boolean indicating whether to print the content of the repository object.
- diff_status: A boolean flag to determine if the status difference should be considered during printing.
- ignore_list: A list of strings specifying file paths to be ignored during the printing process.

**Code Description**: The print_hierarchy function is designed to print the hierarchy of the target repository. It first creates an instance of the Runner class to manage the overall process. Then, it calls the print_recursive function of the target_repo_hierarchical_tree object in the meta_info attribute of the Runner class. This function recursively prints the repository object and its children.

The print_recursive function takes several parameters. The indent parameter determines the level of indentation for the printed output, allowing for a hierarchical representation of the repository structure. The print_content parameter controls whether the content of the repository object should be printed along with its name. The diff_status parameter determines whether the status difference should be considered during printing. If enabled, the function checks the need_to_generate function to decide whether to print the object status along with its type and name. The ignore_list parameter allows specifying a list of file paths to be ignored during the printing process.

The print_recursive function uses a nested function called print_indent to handle the indentation based on the provided indent parameter. It determines the object name to be printed, considering the type of the item. If the item is a root node, it uses the target repository name from the settings.

The function then checks the diff_status flag and the need_to_generate function to decide whether to print the object status along with its type and name. It iterates through the children of the current object, skipping those without tasks if diff_status is enabled. For each child, it recursively calls print_recursive with updated parameters for indentation, content printing, status difference, and the ignore list.

The function ensures proper formatting and hierarchy representation of the repository object and its children during the printing process.

**Note**: It is important to set the appropriate parameters for indentation, content printing, status difference, and the ignore list based on the desired output. The function relies on the need_to_generate function to determine whether to print the object status, so ensure the correct implementation of need_to_generate for accurate printing decisions.
