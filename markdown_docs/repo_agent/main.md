**print_hierarchy**: The function of print_hierarchy is to print the hierarchy of the target repository.

**parameters**:
- indent: An integer representing the level of indentation for the printed output.
- print_content: A boolean indicating whether to print the content of the objects.
- diff_status: A boolean flag to determine if the printing should include differential status.
- ignore_list: A list of strings representing files to be ignored during printing.

**Code Description**: The print_hierarchy function is responsible for printing the hierarchy of the target repository. It first creates an instance of the Runner class. Then, it calls the print_recursive method of the target_repo_hierarchical_tree object in the meta_info attribute of the Runner class. This method recursively prints the repository objects.

The print_recursive method takes several parameters. The indent parameter is used to control the level of indentation for the printed output. The print_content parameter determines whether the content of the objects should be printed. The diff_status parameter is a flag that indicates whether the printing should include differential status. If enabled, the method checks if the object needs to be generated and prints its type, name, and status. Otherwise, it only prints the object type and name.

The method iterates through the children of the current object, skipping those without tasks if differential status is enabled. It recursively calls print_recursive on each child with updated parameters for indentation, content printing, differential status, and the ignore list.

The print_recursive method facilitates the structured printing of repository objects, handling different display scenarios based on the provided parameters.

**Note**: When using the print_recursive method, make sure to provide appropriate values for the parameters to control the output format and content. The recursive nature of the function allows for a hierarchical representation of repository objects.
