## ClassDef ChangeDetector
**ChangeDetector**: The ChangeDetector class is responsible for handling file differences and change detection. It utilizes the FileHandler class to access the file system. The core functionality of the ChangeDetector class is to identify file changes since the last commit.

**Attributes**:
- repo_path (str): The path to the repository.
- repo (git.Repo): The Git repository object.

**Code Description**:
The ChangeDetector class provides several methods to detect and analyze file changes in a Git repository.

The `__init__` method initializes a ChangeDetector object by setting the repository path and creating a Git repository object using the provided path.

The `get_staged_pys` method retrieves the added Python files in the repository that have been staged. It uses the GitPython library to compare the staging area (index) with the original HEAD commit. The method returns a dictionary of changed Python files, where the keys are the file paths and the values are booleans indicating whether the file is newly created or not.

The `get_file_diff` method retrieves the changes made to a specific file. For new files, it adds them to the staging area and then gets the diff from the staging area. For non-new files, it gets the diff from HEAD. The method returns a list of changes made to the file.

The `parse_diffs` method parses the difference content obtained from the `get_file_diff` method. It extracts the added and deleted object information, which can be a class or a function. The method returns a dictionary containing the added and deleted line information.

The `identify_changes_in_structure` method identifies the structures (functions or classes) where changes have occurred. It traverses all changed lines and checks whether each line is within the start and end lines of a structure. If a line is within a structure, the structure is considered to have changed, and its name and the name of the parent structure are added to the corresponding set in the result dictionary. The method returns a dictionary containing the structures where changes have occurred.

The `get_to_be_staged_files` method retrieves all unstaged files in the repository that meet certain conditions. It checks for files with extensions changed to .md that correspond to already staged files, or files with paths matching the 'project_hierarchy' field in the CONFIG. The method returns a list of the paths of these files.

The `add_unstaged_files` method adds the unstaged files that meet the conditions to the staging area.

**Note**: The `identify_changes_in_structure` method may have some issues and requires further testing and improvement. The `get_to_be_staged_files` method may also have some issues and could be implemented in a better way.

**Output Example**:
{
    'added': [
        (86, '    '),
        (87, '    def to_json_new(self, comments = True):'),
        (88, '        data = {'),
        (89, '            "name": self.node_name,'),
        ...
        (95, '')
    ],
    'removed': []
}
### FunctionDef __init__(self, repo_path)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a ChangeDetector object.

**parameters**:
- repo_path (str): The path to the repository.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes a ChangeDetector object by setting the repo_path attribute to the provided repository path. Additionally, it creates a git Repo object using the repo_path.

**Note**:
Ensure that the repo_path parameter is a valid path to the repository before calling the __init__ function to avoid any errors during initialization.

### FunctionDef get_staged_pys(self)
**get_staged_pys**: The function of get_staged_pys is to retrieve added Python files in the repository that have been staged.

**parameters**: 
- None

**Code Description**: 
The `get_staged_pys` function in the `ChangeDetector` class retrieves information about Python files that have been added to the staging area in a Git repository. It first accesses the repository and initializes an empty dictionary to store the staged files. By utilizing GitPython library, the function detects staged changes by comparing the staging area with the original HEAD commit. It then iterates through the detected changes, filters out Python files, and determines whether each file is newly created or modified. Finally, it returns a dictionary containing the paths of changed Python files along with a boolean value indicating if the file is newly created.

This function is crucial for tracking staged Python files in a Git repository, providing insights into the changes made to these files before committing them.

**Note**: 
- It is essential to have GitPython library installed to use this function effectively.
- The function assumes that the repository object (`self.repo`) is properly initialized before calling `get_staged_pys`.

**Output Example**: 
{
    'file1.py': True,
    'file2.py': False,
    ...
}
***
### FunctionDef get_file_diff(self, file_path, is_new_file)
**get_file_diff**: The function of get_file_diff is to retrieve the changes made to a specific file. For new files, it uses git diff --staged to get the differences.

**parameters**:
- file_path (str): The relative path of the file.
- is_new_file (bool): Indicates whether the file is a new file.

**Code Description**:
The `get_file_diff` function retrieves the changes made to a file based on the provided file path and whether the file is new or not. If the file is new, it adds the file to the staging area using Git commands and then retrieves the differences using git diff --staged. For existing files, it gets the differences from the HEAD. The function returns a list of changes made to the file.

This function is called within the `process_file_changes` method in the `Runner` class. In this context, `get_file_diff` is used to obtain the file differences, which are further processed to identify changes in the file structure. The identified changes are then used to update a JSON file and create corresponding Markdown documentation based on the file changes.

**Note**:
Ensure that the `repo` attribute is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid any errors.

**Output Example**:
['- line 10: old code', '+ line 10: new code']
***
### FunctionDef parse_diffs(self, diffs)
**parse_diffs**: The function of parse_diffs is to parse the difference content from a list of differences, extract added and deleted object information, and return a dictionary containing added and deleted line information.

**parameters**:
- diffs (list): A list containing difference content obtained by the get_file_diff() function inside the class.

**Code Description**:
The parse_diffs function processes the differences in the content by iterating through each line, identifying added and removed lines, and storing them in a dictionary. It uses regular expressions to extract line number information and categorizes lines as added, removed, or unchanged based on prefixes. The function then returns a dictionary with added and removed line information.

When called in the project, the parse_diffs function is utilized within the process_file_changes method of the Runner class. In this context, it is used to identify changes in the structure of a Python file by analyzing the differences in the file content. The function plays a crucial role in updating the project's JSON structure information, converting content to markdown, and managing version control operations.

**Note**:
- The parse_diffs function is designed to handle differences in content and is specifically tailored for processing changes in Python files.
- It is essential to provide the parse_diffs function with the correct difference content obtained from the get_file_diff() function to ensure accurate parsing.

**Output Example**:
{'added': [(86, '    '), (87, '    def to_json_new(self, comments = True):'), (88, '        data = {'), (89, '            "name": self.node_name,')...(95, '')], 'removed': []}
***
### FunctionDef identify_changes_in_structure(self, changed_lines, structures)
**identify_changes_in_structure**: The function of identify_changes_in_structure is to identify the structures (functions or classes) where changes have occurred based on the changed lines within those structures.

**parameters**:
- changed_lines (dict): A dictionary containing the line numbers where changes have occurred, with keys 'added' and 'removed'.
- structures (list): A list of function or class structures containing structure type, name, start line number, end line number, and parent structure name.

**Code Description**:
The function iterates through the changed lines and structures to determine which structures have been affected by the changes. It checks if a changed line falls within the start and end lines of a structure, and if so, adds the structure's name and parent structure's name to the result dictionary based on whether the line was added or removed.

In the calling object `process_file_changes` in `runner.py`, this function is utilized to identify changes in the structure of Python files. The `changed_lines` are obtained from parsing the differences in the file, and the `structures` are extracted from the functions and classes in the source code file. The identified changes are then used to update the project hierarchy JSON file, generate Markdown documentation, and stage the changes in the Git repository.

**Note**: Ensure that the `changed_lines` and `structures` parameters are correctly formatted to match the expected input structure.

**Output Example**:
{'added': {('PipelineAutoMatNode', None), ('to_json_new', 'PipelineAutoMatNode')}, 'removed': set()}
***
### FunctionDef get_to_be_staged_files(self)
**get_to_be_staged_files**: The function of get_to_be_staged_files is to retrieve all unstaged files in the repository that meet specific conditions and return a list of their paths.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as the function operates on the instance variables of the class.

**Code Description**:
The `get_to_be_staged_files` method first retrieves the already staged files in the repository. It then identifies unstaged files based on two conditions: 
1. Files that, when their extension is changed to .md, correspond to a staged file.
2. Files whose path matches the 'project_hierarchy' field in the CONFIG.

The function processes untracked files and unstaged files separately. For untracked files, it checks if they belong to the markdown_docs_name folder or match the project_hierarchy. If they meet the conditions, they are added to the list of files to be staged. 

Similarly, for unstaged files, it checks if they belong to the markdown_docs_name folder or match the project_hierarchy. If they meet the conditions, they are also added to the list of files to be staged.

The function then prints relevant information for debugging purposes and returns the list of files to be staged.

In the project, this function is called by the `add_unstaged_files` method in the `ChangeDetector` class. The `add_unstaged_files` method utilizes the list of files returned by `get_to_be_staged_files` to add the unstaged files meeting the conditions to the staging area using Git commands.

**Note**:
- The function relies on the CONFIG settings and the project hierarchy to determine the files to be staged.
- Debug print statements are included in the code for troubleshooting purposes.

**Output Example**:
['path/to/unstaged_file1.py', 'path/to/unstaged_file2.md', ...]
***
### FunctionDef add_unstaged_files(self)
**add_unstaged_files**: The function of add_unstaged_files is to add unstaged files that meet specific conditions to the staging area of the repository.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as the function operates on the instance variables of the class.

**Code Description**:
The `add_unstaged_files` method first calls the `get_to_be_staged_files` method to retrieve a list of unstaged files that meet certain conditions. It then iterates over each file in the list and constructs a Git command to add the file to the staging area using the `subprocess.run` function. The `shell=True` parameter is set to execute the command in a shell environment, and the `check=True` parameter is set to raise an exception if the command fails.

After adding all the unstaged files to the staging area, the method returns the list of unstaged files that were successfully added.

The `add_unstaged_files` method is called by the `run` method in the `Runner` class. The `run` method is responsible for running the document update process, and it utilizes the `add_unstaged_files` method to add the unstaged files meeting the conditions to the staging area before committing the changes.

**Note**:
- The function relies on the `get_to_be_staged_files` method to retrieve the list of unstaged files.
- The function uses Git commands to add files to the staging area.
- Debug print statements are included in the code for troubleshooting purposes.

**Output Example**:
['path/to/unstaged_file1.py', 'path/to/unstaged_file2.md', ...]
