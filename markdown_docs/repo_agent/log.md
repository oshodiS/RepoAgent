## ClassDef InterceptHandler
**InterceptHandler**: The function of InterceptHandler is to intercept standard logging messages and redirect them to Loguru for processing.

**attributes**:
- None

**Code Description**:
InterceptHandler is a class that extends the logging.Handler class. It overrides the emit method to intercept standard logging messages. Within the emit method, it retrieves the corresponding Loguru level based on the log record's level name or number. It then identifies the caller of the logged message and logs the message to Loguru using the retrieved level and message content.

In the project, the InterceptHandler class is utilized in the set_logger_level_from_config function defined in the log.py file. In this function, after setting the logger level and adding a handler to log messages to sys.stderr, an instance of InterceptHandler is instantiated and added to the basic configuration of the logging module. This configuration enables the InterceptHandler to intercept standard logging messages and redirect them to Loguru for further processing. Finally, a success message is logged to indicate the successful setting of the logger level.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage the InterceptHandler class to seamlessly integrate standard logging with Loguru, enhancing the flexibility and functionality of logging mechanisms within their applications.
### FunctionDef emit(self, record)
**emit**: The function of emit is to log a message using Loguru based on the provided log record.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- record: The log record containing information about the log message.

**Code Description**:
The emit function first attempts to determine the corresponding Loguru log level based on the level name provided in the log record. If the level name is not found, it uses the level number from the log record. 

Next, the function identifies the caller's frame to determine the origin of the logged message. It iterates through the frames until it finds the frame that is not part of the logging module.

Finally, the function logs the message to Loguru using the determined log level and the message extracted from the log record. It also considers the exception information from the log record if available.

**Note**:
- The emit function is responsible for handling the logging process and interacting with Loguru for logging messages.
- Developers can customize the behavior of logging by modifying the emit function according to their requirements.

## FunctionDef set_logger_level_from_config(log_level)
**set_logger_level_from_config**: The function of set_logger_level_from_config is to set the logger level based on the provided configuration and log a success message indicating the level change.

**parameters**:
- log_level: The desired logging level to be set for the logger.

**Code Description**:
The set_logger_level_from_config function first removes any existing logger configurations, then adds a new configuration to log messages to sys.stderr with the specified log level. Subsequently, it intercepts standard logging by configuring an instance of the InterceptHandler class and sets the logging level to 0. Finally, a success message is logged to confirm the successful setting of the logger level.

The InterceptHandler class, utilized within this function, intercepts standard logging messages and redirects them to Loguru for processing. By extending the logging.Handler class, InterceptHandler overrides the emit method to handle logging messages effectively. This integration enhances the logging functionality by seamlessly combining standard logging with Loguru, providing developers with more flexibility in managing log messages within their applications.

In the project, the set_logger_level_from_config function is called within the run function defined in the main.py file. By passing the log_level parameter from the project settings, the logger level is configured before executing the main program logic. This ensures that the logging behavior is appropriately set up before the program execution, allowing for effective monitoring and debugging throughout the process.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage the set_logger_level_from_config function to dynamically adjust the logging level based on the application's requirements. By utilizing the InterceptHandler class and Loguru integration, developers can enhance the logging capabilities of their applications and streamline the management of log messages effectively.
