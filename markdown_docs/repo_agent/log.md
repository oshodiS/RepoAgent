## ClassDef InterceptHandler
**InterceptHandler**: The function of InterceptHandler is to intercept standard logging messages and redirect them to Loguru for processing.

**attributes**:
- None

**Code Description**: 
InterceptHandler is a class that inherits from logging.Handler. It overrides the emit method to intercept standard logging messages and redirect them to Loguru for logging. Within the emit method, it retrieves the corresponding Loguru level based on the logging record, finds the origin of the logged message, and then logs the message using Loguru.

In the project, InterceptHandler is utilized in the set_logger_level_from_config function in log.py. In this function, after setting the logger level and adding a handler to log messages to sys.stderr, InterceptHandler is added as a handler to the root logger to intercept standard logging messages and redirect them to Loguru.

**Note**: 
Developers can use InterceptHandler to seamlessly integrate Loguru logging with standard logging in Python applications. This allows for more flexibility and advanced logging capabilities while still leveraging the existing logging infrastructure.
### FunctionDef emit(self, record)
**emit**: The function of emit is to log a message using Loguru based on the provided log record.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- record: The log record containing information about the log message.

**Code Description**:
The emit function first attempts to retrieve the corresponding Loguru log level based on the record's level name. If the level name is not found, it uses the level number from the record. Then, it identifies the caller of the log message by traversing the call stack. After determining the caller, it logs the message to Loguru using the specified log level and message from the record.

**Note**:
- This function is designed to work within a logging framework and relies on Loguru for logging functionality.
- It handles exceptions when retrieving the log level and ensures the proper logging of messages with the caller information.

## FunctionDef set_logger_level_from_config(log_level)
**set_logger_level_from_config**: The function of set_logger_level_from_config is to set the logger level based on the provided configuration and intercept standard logging messages.

**parameters**:
- log_level: The log level to be set for the logger.

**Code Description**:
The set_logger_level_from_config function first removes any existing logger configurations, then adds a new configuration to log messages to sys.stderr with the specified log level. It further intercepts standard logging messages by adding an InterceptHandler to the root logger. Finally, it logs a success message indicating the log level has been set.

The function utilizes the InterceptHandler class to redirect standard logging messages to Loguru for processing. By integrating InterceptHandler, developers can enhance logging capabilities while maintaining compatibility with standard logging in Python applications.

In the project, set_logger_level_from_config is called within the run function in main.py to configure the logger level based on the project settings. This ensures that the logging behavior aligns with the specified log level for the project execution.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage set_logger_level_from_config to dynamically adjust the logging behavior of their applications based on configuration settings. By combining this function with InterceptHandler, they can achieve more advanced logging features and streamline the handling of log messages.
