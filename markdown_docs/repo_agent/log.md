## ClassDef InterceptHandler
**InterceptHandler**: The function of InterceptHandler is to intercept standard logging messages and redirect them to the Loguru logger.

**attributes**:
- None

**Code Description**: 
InterceptHandler is a class that extends the logging.Handler class. It overrides the emit method to intercept standard logging messages and redirect them to the Loguru logger. The emit method first retrieves the corresponding Loguru log level based on the standard logging record. It then identifies the caller frame from where the log message originated and logs the message to Loguru using the retrieved log level and message content.

In the project, the InterceptHandler class is utilized in the set_logger_level_from_config function defined in log.py. Within this function, the logger's level is set based on the provided log_level, and an instance of InterceptHandler is added to the logging configuration to intercept standard logging messages and route them through Loguru. This integration allows for seamless handling of log messages across different logging frameworks.

**Note**: 
Developers can leverage the InterceptHandler class to bridge standard logging with Loguru, enabling a unified logging experience within the project.
### FunctionDef emit(self, record)
**emit**: The function of emit is to log a message using Loguru based on the provided log record.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- record: The log record containing information about the log message.

**Code Description**:
The emit function first attempts to retrieve the corresponding Loguru log level based on the level name from the log record. If the level name is not found, it uses the level number from the record. Then, it identifies the caller's frame where the log message originated by traversing the call stack. Finally, it logs the message to Loguru using the determined log level and the message extracted from the log record.

**Note**:
- This function is designed to be used within a logging handler and relies on the Loguru logging library for logging functionality.

## FunctionDef set_logger_level_from_config(log_level)
**set_logger_level_from_config**: The function of set_logger_level_from_config is to set the logger's level based on the provided log_level, add an instance of InterceptHandler to intercept standard logging messages, and display a success message indicating the log level change.

**parameters**:
- log_level: The log level to be set for the logger.

**Code Description**:
The set_logger_level_from_config function first removes any existing logger configurations, then adds a new configuration with the specified log_level to direct logs to the standard error output. It further configures an InterceptHandler instance to intercept standard logging messages and route them through Loguru. After setting up the logging configurations, the function logs a success message confirming the log level change.

This function is called within the run function in main.py to adjust the logger's level based on the project settings. By utilizing the InterceptHandler class, set_logger_level_from_config enables seamless integration between standard logging and Loguru, ensuring consistent handling of log messages across different logging frameworks.

**Note**:
Developers can leverage set_logger_level_from_config to dynamically adjust the logger's level and enhance logging capabilities within their projects. The integration of InterceptHandler facilitates the interception and redirection of standard logging messages, contributing to a unified logging experience.
