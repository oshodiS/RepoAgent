### FunctionDef get_parallel_summary(self, docs)
**get_parallel_summary**: The function of get_parallel_summary is to process a list of documents concurrently using a ThreadPoolExecutor and return the results.

**parameters**:
- docs: A list of documents to be processed concurrently.

**Code Description**:
The get_parallel_summary function takes a list of documents as input. It then defines a nested function process_document_with_chain, which processes each document using a chain of operations and returns the output text. The function utilizes a ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently process each document using the process_document_with_chain function. The results are collected in a list and returned as the final output.

In the calling object get_first_summarization, the get_parallel_summary function is used to process a list of document splits concurrently. The processed summaries are then further reduced using a chain of operations to generate a single summary.

**Note**:
- The function uses concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel processing.
- Ensure that the input documents are in the correct format for processing.

**Output Example**:
```
['Processed summary 1', 'Processed summary 2', 'Processed summary 3']
