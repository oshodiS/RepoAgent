### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ParallelSummarizator object with the provided path and model name, as well as to set up the stuff_chain and reduce_chain attributes.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the model or data required for summarization.
- model_name: The name of the model to be used for summarization.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the ParallelSummarizator object by assigning the path and model_name parameters to the respective attributes. It then creates an instance of the ChatOpenAI class named llm with a specified temperature value and the provided model_name. Subsequently, the function calls the get_stuff_chain method to initialize the stuff_chain attribute, which is essential for processing text data for summarization. Similarly, the get_reduce_chain method is invoked to set up the reduce_chain attribute, which is used for summarizing multiple documents into a consolidated summary. 

In the context of the project, the __init__ function plays a crucial role in setting up the necessary components for the ParallelSummarizator class to perform summarization tasks effectively. By initializing the llm, stuff_chain, and reduce_chain attributes, the function ensures that the summarization process is streamlined and ready for use.

**Note**:
It is important to provide valid paths and model names when initializing the ParallelSummarizator object to ensure proper functionality. Additionally, the stuff_chain and reduce_chain attributes are initialized within the __init__ function to prepare the object for text summarization tasks.

### FunctionDef get_stuff_chain(self)
**get_stuff_chain**: The function of get_stuff_chain is to create a StuffDocumentsChain object by initializing an LLMChain object with a prompt template and returning the resulting stuff_chain.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The get_stuff_chain function starts by defining a prompt template using a specific text format. It then creates an LLMChain object by passing the llm attribute of the current object (self.llm) and the prompt template. Subsequently, a StuffDocumentsChain object named stuff_chain is instantiated by providing the LLMChain object (llm_chain) created earlier and specifying the document_variable_name as "text". Finally, the function returns the stuff_chain object.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the __init__ method of the ParallelSummarizator class. When an instance of ParallelSummarizator is created, the get_stuff_chain function is invoked to initialize the stuff_chain attribute of the instance. This indicates that the stuff_chain attribute is essential for the functionality of the ParallelSummarizator class.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the prompt template used in this function is suitable for generating concise summaries based on the provided text.

**Output Example**:
A possible output of the get_stuff_chain function is an instance of the StuffDocumentsChain class that is ready to process text data for summarization.

### FunctionDef get_reduce_chain(self)
**get_reduce_chain**: The function of get_reduce_chain is to generate a reduce chain for summarization tasks using a predefined template and language model.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The get_reduce_chain function initializes a reduce_template containing a predefined summarization format. It then creates a PromptTemplate object using the reduce_template, followed by initializing an LLMChain object with the language model and the prompt template. Finally, it returns the generated reduce_chain for further summarization tasks.

In the project structure, the get_reduce_chain function is called within the __init__ method of the ParallelSummarizator class. It is invoked to set the reduce_chain attribute of the class instance during initialization.

**Note**: Developers can utilize the get_reduce_chain function to streamline the process of summarizing multiple documents into a consolidated summary using a specified format and language model.

**Output Example**: 
A reduce_chain object ready for summarization tasks is returned upon calling the get_reduce_chain function.

### FunctionDef get_parallel_summary(self, docs)
**get_parallel_summary**: The function of get_parallel_summary is to process a list of documents concurrently using a ThreadPoolExecutor and return the results.

**parameters**: 
- docs: A list of documents to be processed concurrently.

**Code Description**: 
The get_parallel_summary function takes a list of documents as input. It defines a nested function process_document_with_chain that processes a single document using a chain of operations. Within the function, a ThreadPoolExecutor is used to concurrently process each document using the process_document_with_chain function. The results are collected in a list and returned.

In the calling object get_first_summarization, the get_parallel_summary function is used to process a list of document splits concurrently. The processed summaries are then further reduced using a chain of operations to generate a final summary.

**Note**: 
- This function leverages concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel processing.
- It is important to ensure that the input documents are suitable for concurrent processing to avoid any unexpected behavior.

**Output Example**: 
[summary1, summary2, summary3, ...]
#### FunctionDef process_document_with_chain(doc)
**process_document_with_chain**: The function of process_document_with_chain is to process a document using a chain of operations and retrieve the output text.

**parameters**:
- doc: A document to be processed by the chain of operations.

**Code Description**:
The process_document_with_chain function takes a document as input, then invokes a chain of operations called stuff_chain to process the document. It expects the output text from the stuff_chain operation and returns it as the result.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the stuff_chain operation is properly configured and returns the output_text key in the expected format to avoid any errors.
- Make sure the input document is in the correct format and compatible with the operations in the stuff_chain.

**Output Example**:
"Processed document output text"

### FunctionDef get_first_summarization(self)
**get_first_summarization**: The function of get_first_summarization is to generate a summary by processing a list of documents in parallel and reducing the individual summaries into a final summary.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**: 
The get_first_summarization function first loads documents from a specified path using the load_docs function. It then splits the loaded documents into chunks, processes them in parallel using the get_parallel_summary function, and finally reduces the individual summaries into a single summary. The function utilizes the split_documents and get_parallel_summary functions to achieve this process.

In the project, get_first_summarization is called within the refresh_summary function in main.py to generate a summary based on the loaded documents. The generated summary is then written to a summary.md file in the target repository if it does not already exist.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the input documents are in a suitable format for processing.
- The function relies on the successful execution of load_docs, split_documents, and get_parallel_summary functions.
- Handle any exceptions that may occur during the document processing.

**Output Example**: 
"This is a sample summary generated from the input documents."
