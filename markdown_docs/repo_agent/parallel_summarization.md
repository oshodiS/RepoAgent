### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ParallelSummarizator object with the provided path and model name, along with setting up necessary attributes for document summarization.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the directory containing documents.
- model_name: The name of the language model to be used for summarization.

**Code Description**: 
The __init__ function initializes the ParallelSummarizator object by assigning the path and model_name parameters to the respective attributes. It then loads the documents from the specified path using the load_docs function. Subsequently, it calls the get_stuff_chain function to create a StuffDocumentsChain object and assigns it to the stuff_chain attribute. Finally, the function invokes the get_reduce_chain function to generate a reduce chain for summarization tasks and assigns it to the reduce_chain attribute.

The __init__ function ensures that the ParallelSummarizator object is properly configured with the necessary components for document summarization. By utilizing the get_stuff_chain and get_reduce_chain functions, it sets up the stuff_chain and reduce_chain attributes, enabling efficient summarization workflows within the object.

**Note**: 
Developers using the __init__ function should provide valid paths and model names to ensure successful initialization of the ParallelSummarizator object. Additionally, understanding the role of get_stuff_chain and get_reduce_chain functions in setting up the stuff_chain and reduce_chain attributes is crucial for effective document summarization using the ParallelSummarizator object.

### FunctionDef get_stuff_chain(self)
**get_stuff_chain**: The function of get_stuff_chain is to create a StuffDocumentsChain object by initializing an LLMChain object and returning the stuff_chain.

**parameters**: 
- None

**Code Description**: 
The get_stuff_chain function starts by defining a prompt template for summarization. It then creates an LLMChain object using the llm attribute of the current object and the defined prompt. Subsequently, a StuffDocumentsChain object named stuff_chain is instantiated with the initialized LLMChain object and the document_variable_name set to "text". Finally, the function returns the stuff_chain.

In the calling object, ParallelSummarizator's __init__ function, get_stuff_chain is invoked to initialize the stuff_chain attribute of the ParallelSummarizator object. This initialization process ensures that the stuff_chain is ready for further processing within the ParallelSummarizator object.

**Note**: 
Developers using this function should ensure that the necessary dependencies are imported and the required attributes are properly set in the calling object to avoid any potential errors.

**Output Example**: 
stuff_chain = StuffDocumentsChain(llm_chain=LLMChain(llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.1, model_name="GPT-3"), prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template("""Write a concise summary of the following: "{text}" CONCISE SUMMARY:""), document_variable_name="text"))

### FunctionDef get_reduce_chain(self)
**get_reduce_chain**: The function of get_reduce_chain is to generate a reduce chain for summarization tasks.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**: The get_reduce_chain function initializes a reduce_template containing a predefined summarization prompt. It then creates a PromptTemplate object using the reduce_template, followed by the instantiation of an LLMChain object with the specified language model and prompt. The function returns the generated reduce_chain for further processing in the parallel summarization workflow.

In the project, the get_reduce_chain function is called within the __init__ method of the ParallelSummarizator class to set up the reduce_chain attribute. This attribute is essential for summarizing the overall contents of documents efficiently.

**Note**: Developers utilizing the get_reduce_chain function should understand its role in generating a summarization chain and its integration within the ParallelSummarizator object for effective document summarization tasks.

**Output Example**: 
reduce_chain = LLMChain(llm=ChatOpenAI, prompt=PromptTemplate)

### FunctionDef get_parallel_summary(self, docs)
**get_parallel_summary**: The function of get_parallel_summary is to process a list of documents concurrently using a ThreadPoolExecutor and return the results.

**parameters**:
- docs: A list of documents to be processed concurrently.

**Code Description**:
The get_parallel_summary function takes a list of documents as input. It then defines a nested function process_document_with_chain, which processes each document using a chain of operations and returns the output text. The function utilizes a ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently process each document using the process_document_with_chain function. Finally, it returns a list of results containing the output text of each processed document.

In the calling object get_first_summarization, the get_parallel_summary function is used to process a list of document splits concurrently. It first reads Markdown files from a specified path, splits the documents into smaller chunks, assigns a source metadata to each split, and then passes all the splits to get_parallel_summary for parallel processing. The results are further processed to generate a single summary using a chain of operations.

**Note**:
- The get_parallel_summary function is designed for concurrent processing of documents and may improve performance when dealing with a large number of documents.
- It is important to ensure that the input documents are structured appropriately for processing by the function.

**Output Example**:
['Processed document 1 summary', 'Processed document 2 summary', ...]
#### FunctionDef process_document_with_chain(doc)
**process_document_with_chain**: The function of process_document_with_chain is to process a document using a chain of operations and return the output text.

**parameters**:
- doc: Represents the document to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The process_document_with_chain function takes a document as input, then invokes a chain of operations stored in the stuff_chain attribute. It passes the document as a list to the chain and retrieves the output text from the result, which is returned by the function.

**Note**:
It is assumed that the stuff_chain attribute is initialized and contains the necessary operations for document processing before calling this function.

**Output Example**:
{
    "output_text": "Processed text output"
}
