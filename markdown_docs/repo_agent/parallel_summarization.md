## ClassDef ParallelSummarizator
**ParallelSummarizator**: The function of ParallelSummarizator is to provide parallel summarization capabilities for a set of documents.

**attributes**:
- path: the path to the documents for summarization
- model_name: the name of the model used for summarization
- llm: an instance of the ChatOpenAI model
- docs: the loaded documents from the specified path
- stuff_chain: a chain for processing individual document summaries
- reduce_chain: a chain for consolidating summaries into a final summary

**Code Description**:
The ParallelSummarizator class initializes with the path to the documents and the model name. It loads the documents, sets up chains for processing individual document summaries and consolidating them into a final summary. The class provides methods to generate parallel summaries and obtain the first summarization of the documents.

When the ParallelSummarizator object is created in the Runner class, it initializes with the markdown folder path and the chat completion model. It utilizes the ParallelSummarizator class to perform summarization tasks on the documents in the specified folder.

**Note**:
Developers can utilize the ParallelSummarizator class to efficiently summarize multiple documents in parallel, making it suitable for tasks requiring summarization of large document sets.

**Output Example**:
["Final consolidated summary of the overall contents."]
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ParallelSummarizator object with the provided path and model_name, setting up necessary attributes for further processing.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the directory containing the documents.
- model_name: The name of the language model to be used for summarization.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the ParallelSummarizator object by assigning the path and model_name parameters to the respective attributes. It then initializes the llm attribute with a ChatOpenAI object using the specified model_name and a temperature of 0.1. The function proceeds to load documents from the provided path using the load_docs function and stores them in the docs attribute. Subsequently, it calls the get_stuff_chain and get_reduce_chain functions to set up the stuff_chain and reduce_chain attributes for further processing within the ParallelSummarizator object.

The get_stuff_chain function is invoked to create a StuffDocumentsChain object, while the get_reduce_chain function is called to generate a reduce chain for summarization tasks. These chains play a crucial role in the parallel summarization workflow, enabling efficient processing and summarization of documents.

**Note**:
Developers using the __init__ function should ensure that the path to the documents and the model_name are provided correctly to initialize the ParallelSummarizator object successfully. Additionally, understanding the purpose of the stuff_chain and reduce_chain attributes is essential for utilizing the summarization capabilities of the ParallelSummarizator object effectively.

### FunctionDef get_stuff_chain(self)
**get_stuff_chain**: The function of get_stuff_chain is to create a StuffDocumentsChain object by initializing an LLMChain object and returning the stuff_chain.

**parameters**: 
- None

**Code Description**: 
The get_stuff_chain function starts by defining a prompt template for summarization. It then creates an LLMChain object using the llm attribute of the current object and the defined prompt. Subsequently, a StuffDocumentsChain object named stuff_chain is instantiated with the initialized LLMChain object and the document_variable_name set to "text". Finally, the function returns the stuff_chain.

In the calling object, ParallelSummarizator's __init__ function, get_stuff_chain is invoked to initialize the stuff_chain attribute of the ParallelSummarizator object. This initialization process ensures that the stuff_chain is ready for further processing within the ParallelSummarizator object.

**Note**: 
Developers using this function should ensure that the necessary dependencies are imported and the required attributes are properly set in the calling object to avoid any potential errors.

**Output Example**: 
stuff_chain = StuffDocumentsChain(llm_chain=LLMChain(llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.1, model_name="GPT-3"), prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template("""Write a concise summary of the following: "{text}" CONCISE SUMMARY:""), document_variable_name="text"))
***
### FunctionDef get_reduce_chain(self)
**get_reduce_chain**: The function of get_reduce_chain is to generate a reduce chain for summarization tasks using a predefined template and language model.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**: 
The get_reduce_chain function initializes a reduce_template containing a predefined summarization format. It then creates a PromptTemplate object using the template, followed by initializing an LLMChain object with a specified language model and the created prompt. Finally, the function returns the generated reduce_chain for further summarization tasks.

This function is called within the __init__ method of the ParallelSummarizator class to set up the reduce_chain attribute during object initialization. The reduce_chain is utilized alongside other chains for processing and summarizing documents within the parallel summarization workflow.

**Note**: 
Developers can customize the reduce_template to adjust the summarization format according to specific requirements. Additionally, the language model used for summarization can be modified by passing a different model_name parameter during object initialization.

**Output Example**: 
A generated reduce_chain object ready for summarizing documents based on the predefined template and language model.

### FunctionDef get_parallel_summary(self, docs)
**get_parallel_summary**: The function of get_parallel_summary is to process a list of documents concurrently using a ThreadPoolExecutor and return the results.

**parameters**:
- docs: A list of documents to be processed concurrently.

**Code Description**:
The get_parallel_summary function takes a list of documents as input. It then defines a nested function process_document_with_chain, which processes each document using a chain of operations and returns the output text. The function utilizes a ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently process each document using the process_document_with_chain function. Finally, it returns a list of results containing the output text of each processed document.

In the calling object get_first_summarization, the get_parallel_summary function is used to process a list of document splits concurrently. It first reads Markdown files from a specified path, splits the documents into smaller chunks, assigns a source metadata to each split, and then passes all the splits to get_parallel_summary for parallel processing. The results are further processed to generate a single summary using a chain of operations.

**Note**:
- The get_parallel_summary function is designed for concurrent processing of documents and may improve performance when dealing with a large number of documents.
- It is important to ensure that the input documents are structured appropriately for processing by the function.

**Output Example**:
['Processed document 1 summary', 'Processed document 2 summary', ...]
#### FunctionDef process_document_with_chain(doc)
**process_document_with_chain**: The function of process_document_with_chain is to process a document using a chain of operations and return the output text.

**parameters**:
- doc: Represents the document to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The process_document_with_chain function takes a document as input, then invokes a chain of operations stored in the stuff_chain attribute. It passes the document as a list to the chain and retrieves the output text from the result, which is returned by the function.

**Note**:
It is assumed that the stuff_chain attribute is initialized and contains the necessary operations for document processing before calling this function.

**Output Example**:
{
    "output_text": "Processed text output"
}

### FunctionDef get_first_summarization(self)
**get_first_summarization**: The function of get_first_summarization is to generate a summary for the first document in the target repository.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `get_first_summarization` function is responsible for generating a summary for the first document in the target repository. It starts by printing the path of the current object. Then, it calls the `load_docs` function to load the documents from the specified path. The loaded documents are stored in the `self.docs` attribute.

Next, the function checks if there are any documents loaded. If the `self.docs` list is not empty, it proceeds with further processing. It initializes an empty list called `all_splits` to store the splits of the documents.

The function then iterates over each document in the `self.docs` list. For each document, it calls the `split_documents` function to split the document into smaller chunks of text. The `split_documents` function splits the document based on a specified chunk size and overlap. It assigns a source metadata to each split based on the document's filename. The splits are then added to the `all_splits` list.

After all the documents have been processed, the function calls the `get_parallel_summary` function to process the splits concurrently. The `get_parallel_summary` function takes a list of document splits as input and uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently process each split. It returns a list of results containing the output text of each processed split.

The function then uses the `reduce_chain` object to further process the single summaries generated from each split. It invokes the `reduce_chain` with the single summaries as input and retrieves the final summary from the output text.

Finally, the function returns the generated summary.

**Note**:
- The `get_first_summarization` function is designed to generate a summary for the first document in the target repository.
- It relies on the `load_docs` function to load the documents from the specified path.
- The `split_documents` function is used to split the documents into smaller chunks for parallel processing.
- The `get_parallel_summary` function is responsible for concurrent processing of the document splits.
- The `reduce_chain` object is used to further process the single summaries and generate the final summary.
- Ensure that the input documents are structured appropriately for processing by the function.

**Output Example**:
"This is a summary of the first document."
