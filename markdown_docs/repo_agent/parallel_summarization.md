**parameters**:
- path: The path to the documents for summarization.
- model_name: The name of the language model to be used for summarization.

**Code Description**: 
The __init__ function initializes the ParallelSummarizator object by assigning the path and model_name parameters to the respective attributes. It then initializes an instance of the ChatOpenAI class with the specified temperature and model_name. Subsequently, the function calls the get_stuff_chain and get_reduce_chain methods to set up the stuff_chain and reduce_chain attributes, respectively. This ensures that the ParallelSummarizator object is ready for parallel summarization tasks.

The get_stuff_chain method is invoked to create the stuff_chain attribute, which involves setting up a summarization prompt and initializing an LLMChain object for further processing. Similarly, the get_reduce_chain method is called to generate the reduce_chain attribute, which is essential for consolidating summaries into a final, concise summary.

By invoking the get_stuff_chain and get_reduce_chain methods within the __init__ function, the ParallelSummarizator object is fully prepared with the necessary components for efficient document summarization. This structured initialization process enhances the functionality and usability of the ParallelSummarizator object for summarization tasks.

**Note**: Developers utilizing the __init__ function should ensure that the path and model_name parameters are provided correctly to initialize the ParallelSummarizator object. Additionally, understanding the role of stuff_chain and reduce_chain attributes in the summarization workflow is crucial for effectively utilizing the ParallelSummarizator object in document summarization tasks.

### FunctionDef get_stuff_chain(self)
**get_stuff_chain**: The function of get_stuff_chain is to create a StuffDocumentsChain object by initializing an LLMChain object and returning the stuff_chain.

**parameters**: 
- None

**Code Description**: 
The get_stuff_chain function starts by defining a prompt template for summarization. It then creates an LLMChain object using the llm attribute of the current object and the defined prompt. Subsequently, a StuffDocumentsChain object named stuff_chain is instantiated with the initialized LLMChain object and the document_variable_name set to "text". Finally, the function returns the stuff_chain.

In the calling object, ParallelSummarizator's __init__ function, get_stuff_chain is invoked to initialize the stuff_chain attribute of the ParallelSummarizator object. This initialization process ensures that the stuff_chain is ready for further processing within the ParallelSummarizator object.

**Note**: 
Developers using this function should ensure that the necessary dependencies are imported and the required attributes are properly set in the calling object to avoid any potential errors.

**Output Example**: 
stuff_chain = StuffDocumentsChain(llm_chain=LLMChain(llm=ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.1, model_name="GPT-3"), prompt=PromptTemplate.from_template("""Write a concise summary of the following: "{text}" CONCISE SUMMARY:""), document_variable_name="text"))
***
### FunctionDef get_reduce_chain(self)
**get_reduce_chain**: The function of get_reduce_chain is to generate a reduce chain for summarization tasks.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**: The get_reduce_chain function initializes a reduce_template containing a predefined summarization prompt. It then creates a PromptTemplate object using the reduce_template, followed by the instantiation of an LLMChain object with the specified language model and prompt. The function returns the generated reduce_chain for further processing in the parallel summarization workflow.

In the project, the get_reduce_chain function is called within the __init__ method of the ParallelSummarizator class to set up the reduce_chain attribute. This attribute is essential for summarizing the overall contents of documents efficiently.

**Note**: Developers utilizing the get_reduce_chain function should understand its role in generating a summarization chain and its integration within the ParallelSummarizator object for effective document summarization tasks.

**Output Example**: 
reduce_chain = LLMChain(llm=ChatOpenAI, prompt=PromptTemplate)

### FunctionDef get_parallel_summary(self, docs)
**get_parallel_summary**: The function of get_parallel_summary is to process a list of documents concurrently using a ThreadPoolExecutor and return the results.

**parameters**:
- docs: A list of documents to be processed concurrently.

**Code Description**:
The get_parallel_summary function takes a list of documents as input. It then defines a nested function process_document_with_chain, which processes each document using a chain of operations and returns the output text. The function utilizes a ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently process each document using the process_document_with_chain function. Finally, it returns a list of results containing the output text of each processed document.

In the calling object get_first_summarization, the get_parallel_summary function is used to process a list of document splits concurrently. It first reads Markdown files from a specified path, splits the documents into smaller chunks, assigns a source metadata to each split, and then passes all the splits to get_parallel_summary for parallel processing. The results are further processed to generate a single summary using a chain of operations.

**Note**:
- The get_parallel_summary function is designed for concurrent processing of documents and may improve performance when dealing with a large number of documents.
- It is important to ensure that the input documents are structured appropriately for processing by the function.

**Output Example**:
['Processed document 1 summary', 'Processed document 2 summary', ...]
#### FunctionDef process_document_with_chain(doc)
**process_document_with_chain**: The function of process_document_with_chain is to process a document using a chain of operations and return the output text.

**parameters**:
- doc: Represents the document to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The process_document_with_chain function takes a document as input, then invokes a chain of operations stored in the stuff_chain attribute. It passes the document as a list to the chain and retrieves the output text from the result, which is returned by the function.

**Note**:
It is assumed that the stuff_chain attribute is initialized and contains the necessary operations for document processing before calling this function.

**Output Example**:
{
    "output_text": "Processed text output"
}

### FunctionDef get_first_summarization(self)
**get_first_summarization**: The function of get_first_summarization is to generate a summary of the first document in the target repository.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The get_first_summarization function is a method of the ParallelSummarizator class. It is responsible for generating a summary of the first document in the target repository. The function first prints the path of the current object. It then calls the load_docs function to load the documents from the specified path. The loaded documents are stored in the self.docs attribute of the object.

Next, the function checks if the number of loaded documents is not equal to zero. If there are documents loaded, the function proceeds to split each document into smaller chunks using the split_documents function. The split documents are assigned a source metadata based on the document's filename. All the splits are then concatenated into a single list.

The function then calls the get_parallel_summary function to process the list of splits concurrently. The get_parallel_summary function utilizes a ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently process each split using the process_document_with_chain function. The results are stored in the single_summaries variable.

Finally, the function uses the reduce_chain attribute to invoke the reduce_chain function and generate a single summary from the list of single_summaries. The generated summary is stored in the summary variable.

The function returns the generated summary.

**Note**:
- The get_first_summarization function is designed to generate a summary of the first document in the target repository.
- It relies on the load_docs, split_documents, and get_parallel_summary functions to load, split, and process the documents.
- The function assumes that the target repository contains Markdown documents.
- It is important to ensure that the input documents are structured appropriately for processing by the function.

**Output Example**:
"Generated summary of the first document."
