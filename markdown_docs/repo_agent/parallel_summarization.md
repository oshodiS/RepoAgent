**Code Description**:
The Summarizator class initializes with a path and a model name. It reads documents from the specified path, creates chains for generating concise summaries and distilling them into a final summary. The class provides methods to process documents in parallel and obtain the first summarization by splitting and summarizing the documents.

The get_stuff_chain method creates a chain for generating concise summaries based on a prompt template. The get_reduce_chain method creates a chain for distilling summaries into a final consolidated summary using a reduce template.

The get_parallel_summary method processes documents in parallel using the stuff_chain. The get_first_summarization method reads documents, splits them, generates parallel summaries, and then distills them into a final consolidated summary using the reduce_chain.

**Note**:
- Ensure the path provided leads to the directory containing the documents to be summarized.
- The model_name parameter should correspond to a valid model for summarization.

**Output Example**:
"Project Summary:
** Project Description:** This project aims to develop a new AI-based summarization system for text documents, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.
Please note:
- The final summary should capture the main points and key details from each document."
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Summarizator object with specific attributes and chain objects required for the summarization process.
**parameters**:
- path: The path to the directory containing the markdown files to be summarized.
- model_name: The name of the model to be used for summarization.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the Summarizator object by assigning the provided path and model_name to the respective attributes. It then initializes the ChatOpenAI object (llm) with a temperature of 0.1 and the specified model_name. The function reads the markdown files from the provided path and stores them in the docs attribute. Additionally, it calls the get_stuff_chain and get_reduce_chain functions to set up the stuff_chain and reduce_chain attributes, which are essential for the summarization process.

The get_stuff_chain function is responsible for creating a StuffDocumentsChain object, while the get_reduce_chain function sets up the reduce chain for summarization tasks. By invoking these functions within the __init__ method, the Summarizator object is fully equipped with the necessary components to perform summarization effectively.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the path and model_name parameters are provided correctly to initialize the Summarizator object successfully.
- The get_stuff_chain and get_reduce_chain functions are crucial for setting up the summarization chains and should be called within the __init__ method to prepare the Summarizator object for summarization tasks.

### FunctionDef get_stuff_chain(self)
**get_stuff_chain**: The function of get_stuff_chain is to create a StuffDocumentsChain object by initializing an LLMChain object and returning the stuff_chain.

**parameters**: 
- None

**Code Description**: 
The get_stuff_chain function starts by defining a prompt template for summarization. It then creates an LLMChain object using the llm attribute of the current object and the defined prompt. Subsequently, a StuffDocumentsChain object named stuff_chain is created with the initialized llm_chain and the document_variable_name set to "text". Finally, the function returns the stuff_chain.

In the calling object, __init__, the get_stuff_chain function is invoked to initialize the stuff_chain attribute of the Summarizator object. This ensures that the Summarizator object has a StuffDocumentsChain object ready for further processing.

**Note**: 
- This function does not take any parameters and relies on the llm attribute of the current object to create the necessary chain objects.
- Ensure that the llm attribute is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid any errors.

**Output Example**: 
An instance of StuffDocumentsChain object with the specified llm_chain and document_variable_name.

### FunctionDef get_reduce_chain(self)
**get_reduce_chain**: The function of get_reduce_chain is to generate a reduce chain for summarization tasks.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The get_reduce_chain function initializes a reduce template, creates a prompt template from the template, and then generates a LLMChain object using the provided llm and prompt. This function is responsible for setting up the reduce chain for summarization tasks.

In the project structure, the get_reduce_chain function is called within the __init__ method of the Summarizator class. It is used to initialize the reduce_chain attribute of the Summarizator object, which is essential for the summarization process.

**Note**: This function plays a crucial role in the summarization workflow by setting up the reduce chain for consolidating summaries into a final, comprehensive summary.

**Output Example**: 
reduce_chain = LLMChain(llm=self.llm, prompt=reduce_prompt)
***
### FunctionDef get_parallel_summary(self, docs)
**get_parallel_summary**: The function of get_parallel_summary is to process a list of documents concurrently using a ThreadPoolExecutor and return a list of results.

**parameters**:
- docs: A list of documents to be processed concurrently.

**Code Description**:
The get_parallel_summary function takes a list of documents as input. It then defines a nested function process_document_with_chain, which processes a single document using a chain object and returns the output text. Within the get_parallel_summary function, a ThreadPoolExecutor is used to concurrently process each document using the process_document_with_chain function. The results are collected in a list and returned as the output of the function.

In the calling object get_first_summarization, the get_parallel_summary function is utilized to process a list of document splits concurrently. The processed summaries are then further reduced using a chain object to generate a final summary.

**Note**:
- This function is designed to efficiently process multiple documents concurrently.
- Ensure that the input documents are structured appropriately for processing.

**Output Example**:
['Summary 1', 'Summary 2', 'Summary 3', ...]
#### FunctionDef process_document_with_chain(doc)
**process_document_with_chain**: The function of process_document_with_chain is to process a document using a chain of operations and return the output text.

**parameters**:
- doc: Represents the input document to be processed.

**Code Description**:
The process_document_with_chain function takes a document as input, then invokes a chain of operations represented by self.stuff_chain on the input document. It retrieves the output text from the result of the chain operation and returns it.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the input document is in a format that can be processed by the chain of operations.
- Make sure that self.stuff_chain is properly initialized and contains the necessary operations for document processing.

**Output Example**:
"Processed output text of the document."

### FunctionDef get_first_summarization(self)
**get_first_summarization**: The function of get_first_summarization is to process a list of documents, generate summaries for each document split, and then reduce the summaries to produce a final summary.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**: 
The get_first_summarization function first reads markdown files specified by the path attribute. It then splits the documents into chunks, processes each chunk concurrently using the get_parallel_summary function, and finally reduces the individual summaries to create a comprehensive summary. The function utilizes helper functions like read_md_files, split_documents, and get_parallel_summary to achieve its functionality.

In detail, the function reads markdown files, splits the documents into chunks of 5000 characters each, assigns a source metadata to each chunk, processes the chunks concurrently using get_parallel_summary, and reduces the individual summaries to generate a final summary. The final summary is obtained by invoking the reduce_chain object on the processed summaries.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the path attribute is correctly set to the location of the markdown files to be summarized.
- The function relies on the proper functioning of read_md_files, split_documents, and get_parallel_summary functions.
- It is essential to have the necessary permissions and access to the markdown files specified by the path attribute.
