## ClassDef Summarizator
**Summarizator**: The function of Summarizator is to provide a mechanism for summarizing a set of documents by utilizing a language model to generate concise summaries.

**attributes**:
- path: The path to the directory containing the documents to be summarized.
- llm: An instance of the ChatOpenAI class used for language modeling.
- docs: A variable to store the documents to be summarized.
- map_reduce_chain: A chain of operations for mapping and reducing the documents to generate summaries.

**Code Description**:
The Summarizator class initializes with a path to the document directory and a model name. It utilizes a language model to create a map-reduce chain for summarizing documents. The get_map_reduce_chain method sets up the map and reduce templates, creates LLMChain instances, and configures the map-reduce chain for document summarization. The split_documents method splits a document into chunks based on headers. The get_first_summarization method reads Markdown files from the specified path, splits the documents, and invokes the map-reduce chain to generate a summary.

The Summarizator class is called in the Runner class in the project. The Runner class initializes various components, including the Summarizator instance, to manage the project hierarchy, detect changes, and interact with the chat engine. The Summarizator instance is created with the path to Markdown documents and a chat completion model.

**Note**:
- Ensure the path provided to Summarizator points to a directory containing Markdown files for summarization.
- The language model used for summarization can be customized by changing the model_name parameter in the Summarizator initialization.

**Output Example**:
"A concise summary of the overall contents of the provided documents."

### FunctionDef get_map_reduce_chain(self)
**get_map_reduce_chain**: The function of get_map_reduce_chain is to set up a map-reduce chain for processing a list of documents.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `get_map_reduce_chain` function initializes a map chain and a reduce chain using LLMChain with specific templates for mapping and reducing documents. It then creates chains for combining and reducing documents iteratively. Subsequently, it constructs a MapReduceDocumentsChain that combines the map and reduce chains to process a list of documents. The resulting map-reduce chain is assigned to the `self.map_reduce_chain` attribute.

In the project, the `get_map_reduce_chain` function is called within the `get_first_summarization` function to establish the map-reduce chain for processing split documents. The `get_first_summarization` function is invoked by the `first_generate` and `run` methods in the `Runner` class.

**Note**:
- The `get_map_reduce_chain` function plays a crucial role in setting up the map-reduce chain for document processing.
- It is an essential component in the document summarization process within the project.
- The function is part of a chain of functions that work together to generate a consolidated summary of input documents.

**Output Example**:
"The final consolidated summary captures the main points and key details from each document. The output_text contains the summarized content."
***
### FunctionDef split_documents(self, doc, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**split_documents**: The function of split_documents is to split a document into chunks of text.

**parameters**:
- doc: The document to be split into chunks.
- chunk_size: The size of each chunk of text.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between chunks.

**Code Description**:
The `split_documents` function takes a document, `doc`, and splits it into chunks of text based on specified parameters. It first defines headers to split on, then uses a MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter to split the document based on headers. Next, it utilizes a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to further split the text into chunks based on the chunk size and overlap. Finally, it returns the splits.

In the project, this function is called within the `get_first_summarization` method of the `Summarizator` class. The `get_first_summarization` method reads Markdown files, splits them using `split_documents`, processes the splits, and generates a summary using a map-reduce chain.

**Note**:
Ensure that the `doc` parameter is a valid document object.
Make sure to adjust the `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters according to the desired splitting configuration.

**Output Example**:
```python
[
    Chunk 1: "Text chunk 1...",
    Chunk 2: "Text chunk 2...",
    ...
]
```

### FunctionDef get_first_summarization(self)
**get_first_summarization**: The function of get_first_summarization is to generate a summary of the first document in the target repository. It reads the Markdown files from the specified root path, splits the document into chunks of text, and processes the splits using a map-reduce chain. The resulting summary captures the main points and key details from the document.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `get_first_summarization` function is responsible for generating a summary of the first document in the target repository. It starts by printing the path of the current object. Then, it calls the `read_md_files` function to read the Markdown files from the specified root path and assigns the result to the `self.docs` attribute.

Next, the function checks if the `self.docs` list is not empty. If it is not empty, it initializes an empty list called `all_splits`. It then iterates over each document in the `self.docs` list and calls the `split_documents` function to split the document into chunks of text. The `split_documents` function takes the document, a chunk size, and a chunk overlap as parameters. It returns a list of splits. Each split represents a chunk of text from the document.

Within the iteration, the function also assigns a filename to each split by extracting the basename from the metadata of the document. It then extends the `all_splits` list with the splits.

After processing all the documents, the function assigns the `all_splits` list to the `self.all_splits` attribute.

The function then calls the `get_map_reduce_chain` function to set up a map-reduce chain for processing the splits. The `get_map_reduce_chain` function initializes a map chain and a reduce chain using LLMChain with specific templates for mapping and reducing documents. It combines and reduces the mapped documents iteratively. Finally, it constructs a MapReduceDocumentsChain that combines the map and reduce chains to process the splits. The resulting map-reduce chain is assigned to the `self.map_reduce_chain` attribute.

Finally, the function invokes the map-reduce chain using the `self.all_splits` list as input. It retrieves the output_text from the map-reduce chain's invoke method and assigns it to the `summary` variable.

The function returns the `summary`, which represents the generated summary of the first document in the target repository.

**Note**:
- The `get_first_summarization` function is an essential component in the document summarization process within the project.
- It relies on the `read_md_files` and `split_documents` functions to read and process the Markdown files.
- The `get_map_reduce_chain` function plays a crucial role in setting up the map-reduce chain for document processing.
- The resulting summary captures the main points and key details from the first document.
- Developers can use this function to generate a summary of the first document in the target repository.

**Output Example**:
"The generated summary captures the main points and key details from the first document."
***
### FunctionDef read_md_files(root_path)
**read_md_files**: The function of read_md_files is to read Markdown files from a specified root path and return a list of all the documents found.

**parameters**:
- root_path: The root path from which Markdown files will be read.

**Code Description**:
The `read_md_files` function begins by normalizing and converting the `root_path` to an absolute path. It then iterates through all subdirectories in the `root_path` using `os.walk`. For each subdirectory, it creates a `DirectoryLoader` instance to load Markdown files with the specified glob pattern "./*.md" and using the `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader` loader class. The function then loads the documents using the loader and appends them to the `all_docs` list. Finally, it returns the list of all loaded documents.

The `read_md_files` function is called within the `get_first_summarization` function in the `Summarizator` class to read Markdown files for further processing in the document summarization pipeline.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `root_path` parameter is a valid path to the directory containing Markdown files.
- The function relies on the `DirectoryLoader` class and the `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader` loader class to load Markdown files.

**Output Example**:
An example output of the `read_md_files` function could be a list of Markdown documents like:
["document1.md", "document2.md", "document3.md"]
