## ClassDef Summarizator
**Summarizator**: The function of Summarizator is to provide a mechanism for summarizing a set of documents by mapping and reducing their contents into a consolidated summary.

**attributes**:
- path: The path to the directory containing the documents.
- llm: An instance of the ChatOpenAI class used for language modeling.
- docs: A list to store the loaded documents.
- map_reduce_chain: A chain for mapping and reducing the document contents.

**Code Description**:
The Summarizator class initializes with a path to the documents directory and a model name. It contains methods to split documents into chunks, retrieve the first summarization, and read Markdown files from the specified path. The get_map_reduce_chain method sets up a chain for mapping and reducing document contents using language models. The split_documents function splits a document into chunks based on headers. The get_first_summarization method reads Markdown files, splits them, and invokes the map_reduce_chain to generate a summary.

**Note**:
- Ensure the path provided leads to a directory containing Markdown files for summarization.
- The summarization process involves mapping and reducing document contents to create a concise summary.
- Make sure the model_name parameter is compatible with the ChatOpenAI class.

**Output Example**:
"Summarization of the documents is as follows:
# Title:
**Project Description:** Summary of the project
- Main points and key details are captured effectively.
- Written in English for clarity."
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object with the provided path and model name.

**parameters**:
- path: A string representing the path to the model.
- model_name: A string specifying the name of the model.

**Code Description**:
In this function, the provided path and model name are assigned to the object's attributes. Additionally, a ChatOpenAI instance is created with a temperature of 0.1 and the specified model name. The attributes "docs" and "map_reduce_chain" are initialized to None.

**Note**:
Ensure that the path and model name are correctly provided when initializing an instance of this object.

### FunctionDef get_map_reduce_chain(self)
**get_map_reduce_chain**: The function of get_map_reduce_chain is to create a chain for mapping and reducing documents using LLMChain and related chains.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are passed explicitly to the function.

**Code Description**:
The get_map_reduce_chain function initializes two LLMChain instances, one for mapping and one for reducing documents. It then sets up a chain of operations to combine and reduce documents iteratively. The final MapReduceDocumentsChain is created to handle the mapping and reducing process. Additionally, the function loads a summarize chain using the load_summarize_chain function.

In the calling object get_first_summarization, after splitting the documents and setting metadata, the get_map_reduce_chain function is invoked to create a map-reduce chain. Finally, the invoke method of the map_reduce_chain is called with the split documents to generate a summary.

**Note**:
It's essential to ensure that the documents and summaries provided to the function are within the specified token limit to avoid issues during processing.

**Output Example**:
A consolidated summary of the overall contents extracted from the input documents.
***
### FunctionDef split_documents(self, doc, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**split_documents**: The function of split_documents is to split a document into chunks of text.

**parameters**:
- doc: The document to be split into chunks.
- chunk_size: The size of each chunk of text.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between chunks.

**Code Description**:
The `split_documents` function takes a document, `doc`, and splits it into chunks of text based on the specified `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`. It first defines headers to split on, then uses a MarkdownHeaderTextSplitter to split the document based on headers. Next, it utilizes a RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter to further split the text into chunks based on the specified size and overlap. Finally, it returns the splits.

In the project, this function is called by the `get_first_summarization` method in the `Summarizator` class. In `get_first_summarization`, the `split_documents` function is used to split each document read from markdown files into chunks, which are then processed further in the pipeline to generate a summary.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `doc` parameter is a valid document object.
- The `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap` parameters should be carefully chosen to achieve the desired text chunking.

**Output Example**:
```python
[
    Chunk1,
    Chunk2,
    ...
]
```

### FunctionDef get_first_summarization(self)
**get_first_summarization**: The function of get_first_summarization is to read Markdown files, split them into chunks, create a map-reduce chain, and generate a summary based on the processed documents.

**parameters**:
- No explicit parameters are passed to this function.

**Code Description**:
The get_first_summarization function first reads Markdown files using the read_md_files function, then splits the documents into chunks using the split_documents function. It sets metadata for each split document and creates a map-reduce chain by invoking the get_map_reduce_chain function. Finally, it generates a summary by calling the invoke method of the map_reduce_chain.

In the project structure, get_first_summarization interacts with the read_md_files function to load documents, split_documents to segment the content, and get_map_reduce_chain to establish a map-reduce chain for document processing. The function plays a crucial role in orchestrating the summarization process by coordinating the necessary steps to generate a concise summary from the input documents.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the documents provided to the function are in Markdown format and within the specified token limit to avoid processing issues.

**Output Example**:
A consolidated summary of the overall contents extracted from the input documents.
***
### FunctionDef read_md_files(root_path)
**read_md_files**: The function of read_md_files is to read all Markdown files (.md) within a specified root path and return a list of documents.

**parameters**:
- root_path: The root directory path where the function will start searching for Markdown files.

**Code Description**:
The read_md_files function first normalizes and converts the root_path to an absolute path. It then iterates through all subdirectories using os.walk to find Markdown files. For each subdirectory, it creates a DirectoryLoader object to load Markdown files with the specified file extension ".md" and a loader class UnstructuredMarkdownLoader. The function then loads the documents using the loader and appends them to the all_docs list. Finally, it returns the list of all loaded documents.

In the project, the read_md_files function is called within the get_first_summarization method of the Summarizator class. In this context, the function is used to read Markdown files from a specified path and prepare them for further processing. The retrieved documents are split into smaller segments, processed through a map-reduce chain, and ultimately used to generate a summary.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the root_path provided is a valid directory path containing Markdown files.
- The function relies on the DirectoryLoader and UnstructuredMarkdownLoader classes for loading Markdown files.

**Output Example**:
[doc1, doc2, doc3, ...]
