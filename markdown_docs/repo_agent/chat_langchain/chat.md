## ClassDef ChatRepo
**ChatRepo**: The function of ChatRepo is to provide automatic question and answer capabilities based on specific and general models for documentation explanation.

**attributes**:
- root: The root directory for the chat repository.
- path_marksdown: The path to the markdown folder.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the hierarchy file.
- model_name: The name of the model being used.
- chunk_size: The size of the data chunks.
- chunk_overlap: The amount of overlap between data chunks.

**Code Description**:
The ChatRepo class initializes with specific and general models along with a classification model. It provides a method to get answers based on the classification of the question and starts a chat interaction loop.

In the `get_answer` method, the classification of the question is determined using the classification model. Depending on the classification ('general' or specific), the appropriate model is used to generate a response.

The `start_chat` method initiates a chat session where the user can input questions, and the system responds accordingly until the user decides to exit.

The `chat_with_repo` function in the `main.py` file creates an instance of ChatRepo and starts a chat session, allowing users to interact with the automatic question and answer system for documentation explanation.

**Note**:
Ensure the required parameters are provided during the initialization of the ChatRepo class to enable proper functioning of the automatic question and answer system.

**Output Example**:
```
REPO CHAT

Enter your question: How to install the software?
(me): How to install the software?

(repo): To install the software, follow the steps outlined in the installation guide.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, root, path_marksdown, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object with specific parameters and create instances of other models within the chat_langchain project.

**Parameters**:
- root: The root directory path.
- path_marksdown: The path to the markdown file.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the hierarchy file.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of each data chunk.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between data chunks.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the object by creating instances of SpecificModel, GeneralModel, and ClassificationModel within the chat_langchain project. It takes in the root directory path, paths to markdown and hierarchy files, model name, chunk size, and chunk overlap as parameters. 

The function creates a 'specific' instance using SpecificModel with the provided parameters, a 'general' instance using GeneralModel with the root directory path, markdown and hierarchy paths, and model name, and a 'classificator' instance using ClassificationModel with the markdown and hierarchy paths, and model name.

The SpecificModel instance is responsible for handling specific functionalities within the project, the GeneralModel instance provides specific functionalities tailored for the project, and the ClassificationModel instance is used for classifying general and specific questions in text.

The __init__ function sets up the object by initializing these instances, allowing for the utilization of their respective functionalities within the chat_langchain project.

**Note**:
- Ensure to provide the required parameters when initializing the object to utilize the specific functionalities offered by the SpecificModel, GeneralModel, and ClassificationModel instances.
- The instances created within __init__ are essential components of the chat_langchain project and should be used accordingly within the project context.

### FunctionDef get_answer(self, question)
**get_answer**: The function of get_answer is to classify a given question as specific or general and generate a response based on the classification.

**parameters**:
- question: A string representing the question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_answer function utilizes the get_classification method to determine the classification of the input question. Depending on whether the question is classified as 'general' or 'specific', the function then invokes the corresponding chain to generate a response. The response is returned to the caller for further processing.

In the context of the project, the get_answer function is a crucial part of the chat system, where it plays a key role in providing appropriate responses to user queries based on the nature of the question. By leveraging the classification obtained from the get_classification method, the function ensures that the user receives relevant and accurate responses through the general or specific chain invocation.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the input question parameter is provided accurately to facilitate correct classification.
- Handle the response output effectively in the calling code to utilize the generated response appropriately.

**Output Example**:
If the question is specific:
('specific', 'What is the classification of this question?')

If the question is general:
('response text', 'Can you help me with a question?')

### FunctionDef start_chat(self)
**start_chat**: The function of start_chat is to initiate a chat session where the user can input questions and receive responses based on the classification of the question.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The start_chat function begins by printing a message indicating the start of the chat session. It then enters a loop where the user is prompted to enter a question. If the user inputs 'exit', the chat session ends. Otherwise, the function calls the get_answer method to classify the question and retrieve an appropriate response. The question and the corresponding response are then displayed in the console.

The get_answer method is responsible for classifying the input question as either general or specific. It interacts with the get_classification method to determine the question's classification and then utilizes the appropriate chain to generate a response based on the classification. The response is returned and displayed in the start_chat function.

**Note**:
- Ensure to input questions accurately to receive relevant responses.
- Handle the 'exit' command to end the chat session effectively.
- Utilize the responses generated for further processing or interaction with the chat system.
