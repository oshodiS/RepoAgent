## ClassDef ChatRepo
**ChatRepo**: The function of ChatRepo is to provide automatic question and answer functionality based on specific and general models for chat interactions.

**attributes**:
- path: The path to the model.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the hierarchy file.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of the data chunks.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between data chunks.

**Code Description**: 
The ChatRepo class initializes with specific, general, and classification models. It has a method get_answer to retrieve responses based on the question classification. The start_chat method initiates a chat interaction loop where the user can input questions and receive automated responses based on the models.

When called in the project, specifically in the chat_with_repo function in main.py, the ChatRepo instance is created with the provided parameters, and the start_chat method is invoked to enable a chat session with automated responses.

**Note**: Ensure the necessary models are available at the specified paths for the ChatRepo to function correctly.

**Output Example**: 
```
REPO CHAT

Enter your question: How can I reset my password?

(me): How can I reset my password?

(repo): To reset your password, please follow the steps outlined in the password reset guide.
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ChatRepo object with specific models for handling chat language chain operations.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the model.
- path_hierarchy: The hierarchy path for the model.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of the document chunks.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between document chunks.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the ChatRepo object by creating instances of SpecificModel, GeneralModel, and ClassificationModel. It sets up the specific, general, and classificator attributes with the respective model instances. Each model is initialized with the provided parameters to enable specific functionalities within the chat language chain system.

The SpecificModel instance is created with the path, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, and chunk_overlap parameters. This model loads documents, sets up a vector store, creates a retriever for self-querying, and establishes a chain for chat interactions.

The GeneralModel instance is initialized with the path, path_hierarchy, and model_name parameters. It sets up a template for contextualizing questions, loads documents, sets up a vector store, and creates a runnable chain for chat interactions.

The ClassificationModel instance is created with the path, path_hierarchy, and model_name parameters. It initializes attributes, retrieves methods from the hierarchy, sets up contextualize and classification prompts, and provides methods for classifying user questions based on predefined examples.

These models collectively play essential roles in the chat language chain system, enabling document chunking, contextualizing questions, providing responses, and classifying user queries based on predefined prompts.

**Note**: Ensure to provide the required parameters when initializing the ChatRepo object to leverage the functionalities of the SpecificModel, GeneralModel, and ClassificationModel effectively within the chat language chain system.

### FunctionDef get_answer(self, question)
**get_answer**: The function of get_answer is to classify a user's question as either general or specific, then retrieve an answer based on the classification.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- question: The user's input question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_answer function first calls the get_classification method from the ClassificationModel class to classify the user's question. Depending on the classification ('general' or 'specific'), it invokes the get_chain method of either the general or specific chain to retrieve the answer. The function then returns the response based on the classification.

This function is a crucial part of the chat system as it determines the nature of the user's question and provides an appropriate response. By utilizing classification and chain invocation, it ensures accurate and context-specific answers to user queries.

In the project structure, the get_answer function is called within the start_chat method of the ChatRepo class. This integration allows for real-time interaction with users by processing their questions and providing relevant answers based on the classification.

**Note**:
Ensure that the ClassificationModel class and the chain attributes are properly initialized and accessible to enable accurate question classification and answer retrieval within the get_answer function.

**Output Example**:
If the function is called with a user input "How does this feature work?", and the classification is determined as 'specific', the output answer could be "The feature works by...".

### FunctionDef start_chat(self)
**start_chat**: The function of start_chat is to initiate a chat session where users can input questions and receive answers from the chatbot in real-time.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The start_chat function begins by displaying a message indicating the start of the chat session. It then enters a loop where it prompts the user to enter a question. If the user inputs 'exit', the chat session ends. Otherwise, the function calls the get_answer method to retrieve a response based on the user's question. The user's question and the corresponding answer are then displayed in the chat interface. This process continues until the user decides to exit the chat.

The get_answer method plays a crucial role in providing accurate responses by classifying the user's question and retrieving an appropriate answer based on the classification. By integrating the get_answer function within the start_chat method, the chatbot can interact with users dynamically, processing their questions and delivering relevant responses in real-time.

**Note**:
It is essential to ensure that the get_answer method is properly implemented and accessible within the ChatRepo class to enable seamless question classification and response generation during the chat session. Additionally, the start_chat function relies on user input to drive the conversation flow, making it a key component of the interactive chat experience.
