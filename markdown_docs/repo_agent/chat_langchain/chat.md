## ClassDef ChatRepo
**ChatRepo**: The function of ChatRepo is to provide automatic question and answer capabilities based on specific and general models.

**attributes**:
- root: The root directory for the chat repository.
- path_marksdown: The path to the markdown files.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the hierarchy file.
- model_name: The name of the model being used.
- chunk_size: The size of the data chunks.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between data chunks.

**Code Description**:
The `ChatRepo` class initializes with specific and general models along with a classification model. It provides a method `get_answer` to retrieve responses based on the classification of the input question. The `start_chat` method initiates a chat session where the user can input questions and receive automated responses.

When a question is asked, the `get_answer` method classifies the question and retrieves a response from either the general or specific model based on the classification. The response is then returned to the user.

The `start_chat` method allows users to interact with the chat system by entering questions and receiving automated responses until they decide to exit the chat session.

In the project, the `chat_with_repo` function in `main.py` utilizes the `ChatRepo` class to create a chat instance and start a chat session with the repository. It sets up the necessary parameters such as the root directory, markdown files path, hierarchy file path, model name, chunk size, and chunk overlap before initiating the chat session.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the models and parameters used in the `ChatRepo` class to tailor the chat experience according to their specific requirements.

**Output Example**:
```
REPO CHAT

Enter your question: How to create a new branch?
(me): How to create a new branch?

(repo): To create a new branch, you can use the git checkout -b command.

### FunctionDef __init__(self, root, path_marksdown, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the object with specific models for classifying general and specific questions in text.

**parameters**:
- root: The root directory path.
- path_marksdown: The path to the markdown file.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the hierarchy file.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of data chunks.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between data chunks.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the object by creating instances of SpecificModel, GeneralModel, and ClassificationModel. It sets up specific models for handling different types of questions in text. The SpecificModel is tailored for specific functionalities, the GeneralModel provides a model for the project with specific attributes, and the ClassificationModel classifies questions as general or specific based on predefined criteria. Each model is initialized with specific parameters and functionalities to handle different aspects of text classification within the chat_langchain project.

**Note**:
- The __init__ function plays a crucial role in setting up the models required for text classification in the chat_langchain project.
- It ensures that the object is initialized with the necessary components to handle general and specific questions effectively.

### FunctionDef get_answer(self, question)
**get_answer**: The function of get_answer is to classify input questions and generate a response based on the classification result.

**parameters**:
- question: A string representing the input question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_answer function first calls the get_classification function to classify the input question. Depending on the classification result ('general' or 'specific'), the function then invokes either the general or specific chain to process the refactored question. The response generated by the chain process is returned by the get_answer function.

In the project structure, get_answer is a method within the ChatRepo class. It interacts with the get_classification function to determine the type of question and subsequently utilizes the get_chain function to access the appropriate processing chain for generating a response.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the get_classification and get_chain functions are correctly implemented and initialized to provide accurate question classification and response generation.

**Output Example**:
If the input question is classified as 'specific':
('specific', original_question)

If the input question is classified as 'general':
(response, refactored_question)

### FunctionDef start_chat(self)
**start_chat**: The function of start_chat is to initiate a chat session where the user can input questions and receive responses from the system.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The start_chat function begins by printing a message indicating the start of the chat session. It then enters a loop where it prompts the user to enter a question. If the user inputs 'exit', the chat session terminates. Otherwise, the function calls the get_answer method to retrieve a response based on the user's question. The function then displays the user's question and the system's response in the console.

The get_answer method is responsible for classifying the user's question and generating an appropriate response based on the classification result. It interacts with the get_classification function to determine the type of question and utilizes the get_chain function to access the processing chain for response generation.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the get_answer, get_classification, and get_chain functions are correctly implemented and initialized to provide accurate question classification and response generation. The start_chat function serves as the entry point for interacting with the chat system and should be called within the appropriate context to enable user-system communication.
