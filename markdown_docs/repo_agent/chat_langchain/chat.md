## ClassDef ChatRepo
**ChatRepo**: The function of ChatRepo is to manage a chat session with a repository, utilizing specific and general models to classify and respond to user queries effectively.

**attributes**:
- root: The root path of the repository.
- path_marksdown: The path to the markdown documents.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the project hierarchy file.
- model_name: The name of the model being used.
- chunk_size: The size of data chunks for processing.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between data chunks.

**Code Description**:
The ChatRepo class initializes specific, general, and classification models to handle user questions during a chat session. It categorizes questions as general or specific, then retrieves responses using the appropriate model. The start_chat method allows users to interact with the chatbot by inputting questions and receiving automated answers based on the integrated models.

When the get_answer method is called, the classificator determines the question type, and the corresponding model processes the question to generate a response. The general model is used for general questions, while the specific model handles specific queries. The chat session continues until the user inputs 'exit'.

The chat_with_repo function in the main.py file initiates a chat session by creating an instance of ChatRepo with specified parameters. It checks for markdown documents and project hierarchy files, then starts the interactive chat session, enabling users to ask questions related to documentation.

**Note**:
Ensure that the markdown documents and project hierarchy file are available at the specified paths for the chat session to function correctly. Adjusting the chunk size and overlap parameters can impact the processing of user queries and the generation of automated responses during the chat experience.

**Output Example**:
(me): How do I create a new branch?
(repo): To create a new branch, you can use the 'git checkout -b' command.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, root, path_marksdown, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ChatRepo object with the provided parameters.

**parameters**:
- root: Represents the root directory.
- path_marksdown: The path to the markdown files.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the hierarchy.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of the document chunks.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between document chunks.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function of the ChatRepo class initializes the object with the provided parameters. It takes in the root directory, path to the markdown files, path to the hierarchy, model name, chunk size, and chunk overlap as input.

Within the function, the SpecificModel, GeneralModel, and ClassificationModel objects are instantiated with the path_marksdown, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, and chunk_overlap parameters. These objects are assigned to the specific, general, and classificator attributes of the ChatRepo object, respectively.

The SpecificModel object is responsible for handling specific functionalities within the chat language chain system. It loads markdown documents, sets up a chat language chain, and provides access to the loaded documents.

The GeneralModel object provides functionalities for the chat language chain system, including setting up a chain for chat interactions and loading documents.

The ClassificationModel object handles the classification of user questions based on predefined examples.

**Note**: When utilizing the ChatRepo object, ensure to provide the necessary parameters during initialization to enable proper functionality and handling of user questions effectively.

### FunctionDef get_answer(self, question)
**get_answer**: The function of get_answer is to classify a user's question as specific or general and generate a response based on the classification.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- question: The user's input question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_answer function first calls the get_classification method to determine the classification of the user's question as either 'general' or 'specific'. Depending on the classification, it invokes the conversation chain of either the general or specific chain to generate a response. The function then returns the response based on the classification of the question.

In the project structure, the get_answer function is an integral part of the ChatRepo class, facilitating the dynamic interaction between users and the chatbot. By utilizing the classification mechanism and conversation chains, it ensures that users receive relevant and context-specific responses to their queries during the chat session.

**Note**:
It is crucial to ensure that the get_classification method in the ClassificationModel class is correctly implemented and accessible to enable accurate question classification. Additionally, the proper initialization of the general and specific chains is essential for the get_answer function to retrieve appropriate responses based on the nature of the user's question.

**Output Example**:
If the function is called with a user input "How to use this feature?", the output response could be "To use this feature, you need to follow these steps."

### FunctionDef start_chat(self)
**start_chat**: The function of start_chat is to initiate a chat session where users can input questions, receive answers, and interact with the chatbot in real-time.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The start_chat function begins by displaying a message indicating the start of the chat session. It then enters a loop where it prompts the user to enter a question. If the user inputs 'exit', the chat session terminates. Otherwise, the function calls the get_answer method to retrieve a response based on the user's question. Subsequently, it displays the user's question and the chatbot's response in the console, allowing for a conversational exchange between the user and the chatbot.

The start_chat function serves as a crucial component within the ChatRepo class, enabling users to engage in interactive conversations with the chatbot. By continuously prompting for user input and providing responses based on the get_answer method, it ensures a seamless and dynamic chat experience for users interacting with the chatbot.

**Note**:
It is essential to ensure that the get_answer method is correctly implemented and accessible within the ChatRepo class to enable the generation of accurate responses to user queries during the chat session. Additionally, users can exit the chat session by entering 'exit' when prompted for a question.
