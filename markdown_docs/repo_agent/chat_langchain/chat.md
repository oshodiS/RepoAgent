## ClassDef ChatRepo
**ChatRepo**: The function of ChatRepo is to manage a chat session with a repository, providing automated responses based on specific and general models.

**attributes**:
- root: The root path of the repository.
- path_marksdown: The path to the markdown documents.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the project hierarchy file.
- model_name: The name of the model used.
- chunk_size: The size of data chunks for processing.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between data chunks.

**Code Description**:
The ChatRepo class initializes with specific and general models along with a classification model. The get_answer method determines the type of question and retrieves the response accordingly. The start_chat method initiates an interactive chat session where users can input questions and receive automated responses based on the integrated models.

In the project, the chat_with_repo function serves as a bridge to initiate a chat session with the repository using the ChatRepo class. It configures the chat session with the provided parameters and starts the interactive chat interface for users to engage in documentation-related queries.

**Note**:
Ensure the availability of markdown documents and the project hierarchy file at the specified paths for effective operation. Adjust the chunk size and overlap parameters to influence the processing of user queries and response generation during the chat session.

**Output Example**:
(me): How to create a new branch?
(repo): To create a new branch, use the 'git checkout -b' command followed by the branch name.
### FunctionDef __init__(self, root, path_marksdown, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ChatRepo object with the provided parameters.

**parameters**:
- root: Represents the root directory.
- path_marksdown: The path to the markdown files.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the hierarchy.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of the document chunks.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between document chunks.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function of the ChatRepo class initializes the object with the provided parameters. It takes in the root directory, path to the markdown files, path to the hierarchy, model name, chunk size, and chunk overlap as input.

Within the function, the SpecificModel, GeneralModel, and ClassificationModel objects are instantiated with the path_marksdown, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, and chunk_overlap parameters. These objects are assigned to the specific, general, and classificator attributes of the ChatRepo object, respectively.

The SpecificModel object is responsible for handling specific functionalities within the chat language chain system. It loads markdown documents, sets up a chat language chain, and provides access to the loaded documents.

The GeneralModel object provides functionalities for the chat language chain system, including setting up a chain for chat interactions and loading documents.

The ClassificationModel object handles the classification of user questions based on predefined examples.

**Note**: When utilizing the ChatRepo object, ensure to provide the necessary parameters during initialization to enable proper functionality and handling of user questions effectively.

### FunctionDef get_answer(self, question)
**get_answer**: The function of get_answer is to classify a user's question as specific or general and generate a response based on the classification.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- question: The user's input question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_answer function first calls the get_classification method to determine the classification of the user's question as either 'general' or 'specific'. Depending on the classification, it invokes the conversation chain of either the general or specific chain to generate a response. The function then returns the response based on the classification of the question.

In the project structure, the get_answer function is an integral part of the ChatRepo class, facilitating the dynamic interaction between users and the chatbot. By utilizing the classification mechanism and conversation chains, it ensures that users receive relevant and context-specific responses to their queries during the chat session.

**Note**:
It is crucial to ensure that the get_classification method in the ClassificationModel class is correctly implemented and accessible to enable accurate question classification. Additionally, the proper initialization of the general and specific chains is essential for the get_answer function to retrieve appropriate responses based on the nature of the user's question.

**Output Example**:
If the function is called with a user input "How to use this feature?", the output response could be "To use this feature, you need to follow these steps."

### FunctionDef start_chat(self)
**start_chat**: The function of start_chat is to initiate a chat session where users can input questions and receive answers from the chatbot in real-time.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.

**Code Description**:
The start_chat function begins by displaying a message indicating the start of the chat session. It then enters a loop where it prompts the user to enter a question. If the user inputs 'exit', the chat session ends. Otherwise, the function calls the get_answer method to retrieve a response based on the user's question. The user's question and the corresponding answer are then displayed in the chat interface. This process continues until the user decides to exit the chat.

The get_answer method plays a crucial role in providing accurate responses by classifying the user's question and retrieving an appropriate answer based on the classification. By integrating the get_answer function within the start_chat method, the chatbot can interact with users dynamically, processing their questions and delivering relevant responses in real-time.

**Note**:
It is essential to ensure that the get_answer method is properly implemented and accessible within the ChatRepo class to enable seamless question classification and response generation during the chat session. Additionally, the start_chat function relies on user input to drive the conversation flow, making it a key component of the interactive chat experience.
