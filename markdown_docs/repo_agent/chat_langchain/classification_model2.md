```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize a ClassificationModel object with specific attributes and set up contextualized prompts and a classification chain for text classification tasks.

**parameters**:
- path: A string representing the path to the model.
- path_hierarchy: A dictionary containing the hierarchy of methods.
- model_name: A string specifying the name of the model.

**Code Description**: 
The __init__ method initializes a ClassificationModel object by calling the superclass constructor with the provided path, path_hierarchy, and model_name. It then initializes the history attribute as an empty list. Next, it populates the methods attribute by invoking the get_methods_from_hierarchy function to extract method names from the hierarchy dictionary. Additionally, it calls the __set_contextualize_prompt and __set_classification_chain functions to set up contextualized prompts and a classification chain for the object.

The __set_contextualize_prompt function prepares contextualized prompts for the model, enhancing its ability to interpret user queries accurately within the chat context. On the other hand, the __set_classification_chain function establishes a classification chain within the object, enabling the identification and classification of text based on general question patterns.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly initialized before calling the __init__ method to avoid potential errors related to accessing keys in an empty dictionary.
- The __init__ method sets up essential components for the ClassificationModel object, facilitating text classification tasks within a chat context.

### FunctionDef get_methods_from_hierarchy(self)
**get_methods_from_hierarchy**: The function of get_methods_from_hierarchy is to extract method names from a hierarchy dictionary and return them as a list.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as the function operates on the hierarchy attribute of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The get_methods_from_hierarchy function iterates over the keys of the hierarchy dictionary, then iterates over the items in the corresponding list, extracting the "name" key from each item and appending it to the methods list. Finally, it returns the list of method names.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the __init__ method of the ClassificationModel class. When an instance of ClassificationModel is initialized, the get_methods_from_hierarchy function is invoked to populate the methods attribute with the extracted method names from the hierarchy dictionary. This allows the ClassificationModel object to have access to the list of methods defined in the hierarchy.

**Note**: 
It is essential to ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid any potential errors related to accessing keys in an empty dictionary.

**Output Example**: 
If the hierarchy dictionary contains the following structure:
{
    "class1": [{"name": "method1"}, {"name": "method2"}],
    "class2": [{"name": "method3"}]
}

The function get_methods_from_hierarchy will return:
["method1", "method2", "method3"]

### FunctionDef get_classification(self, question)
**get_classification**: The function of get_classification is to classify a user's question as specific or general and generate a response based on the classification.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- question: The user's input question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_classification function first utilizes the classify_trought_name method to determine if the question is specific. If the question is specific, it prints the classification and returns it along with the original question. If the question is not specific, it generates a standalone question using the __generate_standalone_question method. The conversation chain is then run with the standalone question to produce a response. The function ultimately returns the response and the refactored question.

This function is an essential part of the ClassificationModel class, enabling the accurate classification of user questions and the generation of appropriate responses based on the nature of the question. By leveraging the classification mechanism and conversation chain, it ensures relevant and context-specific interactions with users.

***
## FunctionDef convert_history(history)
**convert_history**: The function of convert_history is to transform the message history into a new format suitable for further processing.

**parameters**:
- history: The message history to be converted.

**Code Description**:
The convert_history function takes a message history as input and converts it into a new format. It first checks if the history is empty, in which case it returns an empty list. Then, it creates a list of roles alternating between "user" and "system" based on the number of messages in the history. Next, it iterates over each message in the history, extracts the role and content, and appends them to a new list. Finally, it returns the new formatted history.

This function is designed to prepare the message history for further processing or analysis by restructuring it into a more manageable format.

In the project, this function is utilized to convert the message history before generating a standalone question in the ClassificationModel class. By converting the history, it ensures that the chat context is appropriately formatted for the subsequent steps in the conversation flow.

**Note**:
It is essential to provide a valid message history as input to the convert_history function to obtain the desired formatted output.

**Output Example**:
If the function is called with a message history containing two messages from a user and a system, the output could be:
[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"},
    {"role": "system", "content": "Hi there"}
]
