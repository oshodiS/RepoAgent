## ClassDef ClassificationModel
**ClassificationModel**: The function of ClassificationModel is to provide a model for classifying general and specific questions in text.

**Attributes**:
- `history`: A list to store the history of the model.
- `methods`: A list of methods obtained from the hierarchy.
- `contextualize_q_prompt`: A chat prompt template for contextualizing questions.
- `chain`: An instance of the LLMChain for classification.

**Code Description**:
The `ClassificationModel` class inherits from the `Model` class and initializes with `path`, `path_hierarchy`, and `model_name`. It sets the `history` list, retrieves `methods` from the hierarchy, and initializes `contextualize_q_prompt` and `chain` for classification. 

The class provides methods like `get_classification` to classify questions, `classify_trough_name` to classify based on methods, `__set_contextualize_prompt` to set the contextualize question prompt, `__generate_standalone_question` to generate a standalone question, and `__set_classification_chain` to set up the classification chain.

The `get_classification` method classifies questions as general or specific, while `classify_trough_name` checks for specific methods in the question. Private methods like `__set_contextualize_prompt` and `__generate_standalone_question` handle setting prompts and generating questions. `__set_classification_chain` initializes the classification chain.

The class utilizes the LLMChain for classification tasks and interacts with the hierarchy to obtain methods for classification.

**Note**: The `ClassificationModel` class is designed to classify general and specific questions and should be used within the context of the chat_langchain project.

**Output Example**:
```python
model = ClassificationModel(path="path/to/model", path_hierarchy="path/to/hierarchy", model_name="model")
classification, question = model.get_classification("What is the project about?")
response, refactored_question = model.get_classification("Explain the function of a method")
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ClassificationModel object with specific attributes and configurations.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the model.
- path_hierarchy: The path hierarchy information.
- model_name: The name of the model.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the ClassificationModel object by calling the superclass's init method with the provided path, path_hierarchy, and model_name. It then initializes the history attribute as an empty list. Next, it populates the methods attribute by calling the get_methods_from_hierarchy function to extract method names from the hierarchy. Additionally, the function sets up a contextualized prompt for user questions using __set_contextualize_prompt and establishes a classification chain for identifying general questions in text using __set_classification_chain.

This function plays a crucial role in setting up the ClassificationModel object with necessary attributes and configurations for handling user questions within a chat context. By calling other internal functions, it ensures that the object is ready to classify and respond to user queries effectively based on the provided model and hierarchy information.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that the required parameters are provided when initializing a ClassificationModel object to avoid any potential errors. It is essential to understand the flow of attribute initialization and method extraction within the __init__ function to utilize the ClassificationModel effectively within the chat_langchain project.

### FunctionDef get_methods_from_hierarchy(self)
**get_methods_from_hierarchy**: The function of get_methods_from_hierarchy is to extract method names from a hierarchy dictionary.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as the function operates on the instance variable `self.hierarchy`.

**Code Description**: 
The `get_methods_from_hierarchy` function iterates over the keys of the `self.hierarchy` dictionary. For each key, it then iterates over the list of items associated with that key. The function extracts the value of the "name" key from each item and appends it to the `methods` list. Finally, it returns the list of method names.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the `__init__` method of the `ClassificationModel` class. When an instance of `ClassificationModel` is created, the `get_methods_from_hierarchy` function is invoked to populate the `methods` attribute with the extracted method names from the hierarchy.

**Note**: 
It is important to ensure that the `self.hierarchy` attribute is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid any potential errors related to accessing keys in an empty dictionary.

**Output Example**: 
If `self.hierarchy` is `{'key1': [{'name': 'method1'}, {'name': 'method2'}], 'key2': [{'name': 'method3'}]}`, the function will return `['method1', 'method2', 'method3']`.

### FunctionDef get_classification(self, question)
**get_classification**: The function of get_classification is to classify a given question as specific or general and generate a response based on the classification.

**parameters**:
- question: A string representing the question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_classification function first calls the classify_trough_name function to determine if the question is specific. If the question is specific, the name of the classification is printed, and the same value is returned along with the original question. If the question is not specific, a refactored question is generated using the __generate_standalone_question function. The refactored question is then processed through a chain to generate a response, which is returned along with the refactored question.

In the calling object get_answer, the get_classification function is used to obtain the classification of the question. Depending on the classification ('general' or specific), different chains are invoked to generate a response.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the input question parameter is provided correctly to classify the question accurately.
- Handle the output of this function appropriately in the calling code to process the generated response effectively.

**Output Example**:
If the question is specific:
('specific', 'What is the classification of this question?')

If the question is general:
('response text', 'Can you help me with a question?')
***
### FunctionDef classify_trough_name(self, question)
The function of classify_trough_name is to check if a given question contains specific methods.

**parameters**:
- question: A string representing the question to be analyzed.

**Code Description**:
The classify_trough_name function iterates through a list of methods and checks if any of the methods are present in the given question. If a method is found in the question, the function returns '\n specific', indicating that the question is specific. If no method is found, an empty string is returned.

In the calling object get_classification, the classify_trough_name function is used to determine if the question is specific. If the function returns '\n specific', the name of the classification is printed, and the same value is returned along with the original question. If the question is not specific, a refactored question is generated, processed through a chain, and the response is returned along with the refactored question.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the list of methods in the calling object matches the expected methods in the classify_trough_name function to achieve accurate classification.

**Output Example**:
If the question contains a method:
'\n specific'

If the question does not contain any method:
''
***
### FunctionDef __set_contextualize_prompt(self)
**__set_contextualize_prompt**: The function of __set_contextualize_prompt is to set up a contextualized prompt for user questions within a chat context.

**parameters**: 
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The __set_contextualize_prompt function initializes the contextualize_q_prompt attribute of the object by creating a prompt template using ChatPromptTemplate. The prompt template consists of a system prompt generated by the get_contextualize_q_system_prompt function from utilities.py, a placeholder for chat history, and the latest user question. This setup allows for contextualizing user questions within a chat context, ensuring a seamless interaction flow. The function is an essential part of the ClassificationModel class in the project, enabling the generation of prompts tailored to the chat context.

**Note**: 
Developers using this function should ensure that the contextualize_q_prompt is appropriately set up to provide relevant prompts for user questions within the chat context. It is crucial to maintain the integrity of the chat history and user input within the prompt template for effective contextualization.
***
### FunctionDef __generate_standalone_question(self, user_input)
**__generate_standalone_question**: The function of __generate_standalone_question is to generate a standalone question based on user input by utilizing the LLMChain model.

**parameters**:
- self: Represents the instance of the class.
- user_input: Represents the input provided by the user.

**Code Description**:
The __generate_standalone_question function initializes an LLMChain object with the specified language model and contextualized question prompt. It then calls the convert_history function to transform the session history retrieved using the get_session_history method into a suitable format for the LLMChain model. Subsequently, the function runs the LLMChain model with the converted chat history and user input to generate a standalone question. The generated standalone question is returned as the output of the function.

In the context of the ClassificationModel class, this function plays a crucial role in preparing the necessary input data for the LLMChain model to generate a relevant standalone question based on the user's input.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the input user_input parameter is provided correctly to generate an accurate standalone question.
- Handle the output of this function appropriately in the calling code to utilize the generated standalone question effectively.

**Output Example**:
```python
"Can you help me with a question?"
```
***
### FunctionDef __set_classification_chain(self)
**__set_classification_chain**: The function of __set_classification_chain is to set up a classification chain for identifying general questions in text.

**parameters**: 
- None

**Code Description**: 
The __set_classification_chain function initializes a classifier to identify general questions in text. It sets a prompt template with examples of general questions and initializes an LLMChain classifier using the provided prompt template and a language model. The function then assigns the classifier to the 'chain' attribute of the object.

This function is called within the __init__ method of the ClassificationModel class. When an instance of ClassificationModel is created, the __set_classification_chain function is automatically invoked to set up the classification chain for identifying general questions in text.

**Note**: 
Developers can utilize this function to establish a classification chain for distinguishing between general and specific questions in text data.
***
## FunctionDef convert_history(history)
**convert_history**: The function of convert_history is to transform a given chat history into a new format suitable for further processing.

**parameters**:
- history: Represents the chat history to be converted.

**Code Description**:
The convert_history function takes a chat history as input and converts it into a new format. It first checks if the history contains any messages. If the history is not empty, it creates a new list called new_history. It then generates a list of roles alternating between "user" and "system" based on the number of messages in the history. Finally, it iterates through each message in the history, extracts the role and content, and appends them as a dictionary to the new_history list. The function returns the new_history list as the output.

In the project, the convert_history function is called within the __generate_standalone_question method of the ClassificationModel class. In this context, the function is used to convert the session history retrieved using the get_session_history method into a format suitable for the LLMChain model to generate a standalone question based on user input.

**Note**:
Ensure that the input history parameter is a valid chat history object with messages.
Make sure to handle the output of the convert_history function appropriately in the calling code.

**Output Example**:
```python
[
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"},
    {"role": "system", "content": "I'm doing well, thank you for asking."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Can you help me with a question?"},
    {"role": "system", "content": "Of course, I'll do my best to assist you."}
]
```
