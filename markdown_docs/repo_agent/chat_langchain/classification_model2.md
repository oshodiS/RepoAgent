## ClassDef ClassificationModel
**ClassificationModel**: The function of ClassificationModel is to provide a model for classifying general and specific questions in text.

**Attributes**:
- `history`: A list to store the chat history.
- `methods`: A list of methods extracted from the hierarchy.
- `contextualize_q_prompt`: A chat prompt template for contextualizing questions.
- `chain`: A runnable chain for processing chat messages.

**Code Description**:
The `ClassificationModel` class inherits from the `Model` class and initializes with a path, path hierarchy, and model name. It sets up the chat history, extracts methods from the hierarchy, sets contextualize question prompt, and establishes a classification chain.

The `get_methods_from_hierarchy` method extracts methods from the hierarchy and returns a list of method names.

The `get_classification` method classifies questions as general or specific based on the presence of method names. It generates a standalone question, runs it through the chain, and returns the response.

The `classify_trought_name` method checks if a method name is present in the question and classifies it as specific.

The `__set_contextualize_prompt` method creates a contextualize question prompt template for the model.

The `__add_to_history` method adds user input and system output to the chat history, maintaining a maximum history length.

The `__generate_standalone_question` method generates a standalone question by running the input through a chain with contextualized prompts.

The `__set_classification_chain` method sets up a classification chain with a predefined prompt template and initializes the chain for classification.

**Note**:
- The `ClassificationModel` class is designed for classifying general and specific questions in text.
- It utilizes methods for extracting methods, classifying questions, managing chat history, and setting up classification chains.

**Output Example**:
```python
model = ClassificationModel(path, path_hierarchy, model_name)
response, question = model.get_classification("What is this program about?")
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ClassificationModel object with specific attributes and set up necessary configurations for the classification model.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the model.
- path_hierarchy: The path hierarchy for the model.
- model_name: The name of the model.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the ClassificationModel object by calling the superclass's init method with the provided path, path_hierarchy, and model_name. It then initializes the history attribute as an empty list, populates the methods attribute by calling the get_methods_from_hierarchy function, and sets up the contextualized prompt and classification chain using the __set_contextualize_prompt and __set_classification_chain functions respectively.

By calling get_methods_from_hierarchy, the methods attribute is populated with method names extracted from the hierarchy dictionary, allowing the object to access the methods defined in the hierarchy during initialization. The __set_contextualize_prompt function prepares a contextualized prompt for the chatbot system based on the latest user question and chat history. On the other hand, the __set_classification_chain function establishes a classification chain for identifying general questions in text.

**Note**:
It is crucial to ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly initialized before calling get_methods_from_hierarchy to avoid any potential errors related to accessing keys or values in an empty dictionary. Additionally, integrating the __set_contextualize_prompt and __set_classification_chain functions within the ClassificationModel class is essential for setting up the necessary configurations for the chatbot system and text classification tasks.

### FunctionDef get_methods_from_hierarchy(self)
**get_methods_from_hierarchy**: The function of get_methods_from_hierarchy is to extract method names from a hierarchy dictionary.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as the function operates on the hierarchy attribute of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The get_methods_from_hierarchy function iterates over the keys of the hierarchy dictionary, then iterates over the items in each key's value list. It extracts the "name" key from each item and appends it to the methods list. Finally, it returns the list of method names.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the __init__ method of the ClassificationModel class. By calling get_methods_from_hierarchy, the methods attribute of the object is populated with the list of method names extracted from the hierarchy dictionary. This allows the object to have access to the methods defined in the hierarchy during initialization.

**Note**: 
It is essential to ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly initialized before calling get_methods_from_hierarchy to avoid any potential errors related to accessing keys or values in an empty dictionary.

**Output Example**: 
If the hierarchy dictionary contains the following structure:
```python
{
    "key1": [
        {"name": "method1"},
        {"name": "method2"}
    ],
    "key2": [
        {"name": "method3"}
    ]
}
```
The function get_methods_from_hierarchy will return:
```python
["method1", "method2", "method3"]
```

### FunctionDef get_classification(self, question)
**get_classification**: The function of get_classification is to classify input questions based on method names and generate a response accordingly.

**parameters**:
- question: A string representing the input question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_classification function first utilizes the classify_trought_name function to check if the input question contains any method names. If a method name is found, the function returns the classification along with the original question. Otherwise, it generates a standalone question using the __generate_standalone_question function and obtains a response through a chain process before returning it.

In the project structure, get_classification is called by the get_answer function in the ChatRepo class. Depending on the classification result ('general' or 'specific'), get_answer invokes different chains to generate a response for the input question.

**Note**:
It is essential to ensure that the classify_trought_name and __generate_standalone_question functions are functioning correctly to provide accurate question classification and response generation.

**Output Example**:
If the input question is specific to a method:
('specific', original_question)

If the input question is not specific to a method:
(response, refactored_question)
***
### FunctionDef classify_trought_name(self, question)
The function of classify_trought_name is to check if any method name is present in the input question and return a specific string if a match is found.

**Parameters**:
- question: A string representing the input question to be analyzed.

**Code Description**:
The classify_trought_name function iterates through the list of methods stored in the object. It checks if any method name is present in the input question. If a method name is found in the question, the function returns '\n specific'. If no method name is found, an empty string is returned.

In the calling object get_classification, the classify_trought_name function is utilized to determine if the input question is specific to a method. If the function returns '\n specific', the question is considered specific, and the classification is printed and returned along with the original question. Otherwise, the input question is processed further, and the response is obtained through a chain process before being returned.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the list of methods in the object is up to date to accurately classify questions based on method names.

**Output Example**:
If the input question contains a method name:
'\n specific'

If the input question does not contain any method name:
''

**parameters**:
- self: Represents the instance of the class.
- user_input: A string containing the user's input question.

**Code Description**:
The __generate_standalone_question function initializes an LLMChain object with a specified language model and prompt. It then converts the session history using the convert_history function to prepare it for generating a standalone question. The function runs the language model chain with the converted history and user input to produce a standalone question, which is returned as the output.

In the context of the project, this function is a crucial step in the question generation process within the ClassificationModel class. By leveraging the language model chain and the converted history, it enables the system to respond to user input with a relevant standalone question.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the input history object has a 'messages' attribute that contains the chat messages.
- The role alternates between "user" and "system" for each message in the converted history list.

**Output Example**:
```python
[
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather like today?"},
    {"role": "system", "content": "The weather is sunny with a high of 75 degrees."},
]
```
