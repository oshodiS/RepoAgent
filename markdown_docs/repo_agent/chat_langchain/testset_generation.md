## ClassDef DataGenerator
**DataGenerator**: The function of DataGenerator is to generate specific and general test sets for language chain models using a pre-trained ChatOpenAI model.

**attributes**:
- path: The path to the documents used for test set generation.
- docs: Loaded documents from the specified path.
- all_splits: Chunked documents with their sources.
- summary: Filtered documents for summary generation.
- summary_splits: Chunked summary documents with their sources.
- model: An instance of the ChatOpenAI model "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125" for test set generation.

**Code Description**:
The DataGenerator class initializes with a path to load documents and initializes various attributes such as docs, all_splits, summary, summary_splits, and the ChatOpenAI model. It provides two main methods:
1. generate_specific(n_samples): Generates a specific test set by utilizing TestsetGenerator and specifying the number of samples to generate.
2. generate_general(): Generates a general test set by defining a prompt template, creating an LLMChain with the ChatOpenAI model, providing QA examples, and running the document chain to generate new question and answer pairs based on the document and QA examples.

**Note**:
- The DataGenerator class relies on utilities functions for document loading, filtering, and chunking.
- The generate_general method uses a prompt template and QA examples to generate general test sets based on the provided document.

**Output Example**:
[("Q1", "A1"), ("Q2", "A2"), ...]
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the DataGenerator object with the provided path and set up necessary attributes for further data processing.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the data source.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function takes a path as input and assigns it to the 'path' attribute of the DataGenerator object. It then loads documents from the specified path using the utilities.load_docs function and stores them in the 'docs' attribute. Subsequently, it splits the loaded documents into chunks with assigned sources using utilities.get_chunk_with_source and stores the result in the 'all_splits' attribute. The function further filters the documents based on the presence of "summary.md" in the metadata source field using utilities.filter_docs and stores the filtered documents in the 'summary' attribute. Additionally, it creates summary splits with assigned sources using utilities.get_chunk_with_source and stores them in the 'summary_splits' attribute. Finally, the function initializes a ChatOpenAI model with the specified configuration and assigns it to the 'model' attribute of the DataGenerator object.

**Note**:
- Ensure the path provided leads to the correct data source.
- The function relies on utilities.load_docs, utilities.get_chunk_with_source, and utilities.filter_docs to load, split, and filter documents, respectively.
- The ChatOpenAI model is initialized with the "gpt-3.5-turbo-0125" configuration for further processing.

### FunctionDef generate_specific(self, n_samples)
**generate_specific**: The function of generate_specific is to generate a specific number of samples using TestsetGenerator with language chain documentation.

**parameters**:
- n_samples: An integer representing the number of samples to generate (default value is 55).

**Code Description**:
The generate_specific function initializes a TestsetGenerator object with the OpenAI API and then generates samples with language chain documentation based on the specified parameters. It uses the all_splits attribute, test_size parameter, and distributions dictionary to control the generation process.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the all_splits attribute is properly defined and contains the necessary data for sample generation.
- The distributions dictionary should have keys 'simple', 'reasoning', and 'multi_context' with corresponding float values that sum up to 1.

**Output Example**:
{
    "sample1": {
        "text": "Sample text 1",
        "category": "simple"
    },
    "sample2": {
        "text": "Sample text 2",
        "category": "reasoning"
    },
    ...
}

### FunctionDef generate_general(self)
**generate_general**: The function of generate_general is to generate 25 similar question and answer pairs based on a given document and QA examples.

**parameters**: 
- self: The instance of the class.
  
**Code Description**: 
The generate_general function defines a prompt template for generating new documents based on a given document and QA examples. It then creates a language model chain using the defined prompt. The function takes QA examples in the form of questions and answers, and generates 25 similar question and answer pairs related to the project description. The generated pairs are based on the provided document and QA examples.

**Note**: 
- The function utilizes a language model to generate question and answer pairs.
- The QA examples should be provided in a specific format with questions and answers separated by commas.
- The function returns the generated question and answer pairs.

**Output Example**: 
{
    "Q1": "What is the purpose of the project?",
    "A1": "It is an open source module able to extracts skills and certification from unstructured job postings, text and resumes.",
    ...
    "Q25": "How does the project work?",
    "A25": "SkillNer receives unstructured text as input, parses it through the SpaCy library, and begins analyzing it. It uses the EMSI database to match the main skills and certifications. By using different matching techniques, it identifies the various skills within the text. Finally, it displays the annotated skills in a structured format."
