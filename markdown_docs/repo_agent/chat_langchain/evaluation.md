## FunctionDef evaluate_ds(test_question, test_groundtruths, classification_groundtruths, chain)
**evaluate_ds**: The function of evaluate_ds is to evaluate a dataset of test questions, generate responses, calculate various metrics, and determine the accuracy of question classifications.

**parameters**:
- test_question: A list of strings representing test questions.
- test_groundtruths: A list of ground truth answers corresponding to the test questions.
- classification_groundtruths: A list of ground truth classifications for the questions.
- chain: An object representing the chat chain used for generating responses.

**Code Description**:
The evaluate_ds function processes each test question by obtaining a response from the chain using the get_answer function. It collects the answers, contexts, and classifications for each question and constructs a response dataset. Subsequently, it defines a set of metrics to evaluate the responses and calculates the evaluation results. Additionally, the function computes the accuracy score for the question classifications. Finally, it returns the evaluation results and the classification accuracy score.

The function relies on the get_answer method from the chain object to classify questions and generate responses. By leveraging this method, evaluate_ds ensures that the responses are relevant and accurate based on the nature of the input questions. The evaluation process enables the assessment of response quality and the correctness of question classifications.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the input parameters are correctly formatted to align with the expected data structures.
- Handle the evaluation results and classification score appropriately in the calling code for further analysis or reporting.

**Output Example**:
(results, classification_score)
