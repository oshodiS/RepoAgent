## ClassDef ClassificationModel
**ClassificationModel**: The function of ClassificationModel is to provide a model for classifying user questions into general or specific categories based on predefined prompts and methods.

**Attributes**:
- `history`: A list to store the history of user interactions.
- `methods`: A list of methods extracted from the hierarchy.
- `contextualize_q_prompt`: A template for contextualizing user questions.
- `prompt`: A prompt template for classifying user questions.

**Code Description**:
The `ClassificationModel` class extends the `Model` class and implements methods for classifying user questions. Upon initialization, it sets up the history list, extracts methods from the hierarchy, and initializes contextualize and classification prompts.

The `get_methods_from_hierarchy` method extracts methods from the hierarchy dictionary and returns a list of method names.

The `get_classification` method classifies user questions as general or specific based on predefined prompts and methods. It also generates standalone questions for specific inquiries.

The `classify_trough_name` method checks if a method name is present in the user question to determine specificity.

The `__set_contextualize_prompt` method creates a contextualize question prompt template for user interactions.

The `__add_to_history` method manages the history list by adding user and system messages while maintaining a maximum history length.

The `__generate_standalone_question` method generates standalone questions by running a question-answer chain with historical context.

The `__set_classification_prompt` method sets up examples and a prompt template for classifying user questions as general or specific.

**Note**: The `ClassificationModel` class provides functionality for classifying user questions and managing historical interactions within the chat_langchain project.

**Output Example**:
```python
model = ClassificationModel(path="path/to/model", path_hierarchy="path/to/hierarchy", model_name="model")
classification = model.get_classification(question="What is this function for?")
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ClassificationModel object with specific attributes and set up contextualized and classification prompts for further interactions within a chat context.

**parameters**:
- path: Represents the path of the model.
- path_hierarchy: Indicates the hierarchy of paths.
- model_name: Specifies the name of the model.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ method initializes the ClassificationModel object by calling the superclass's __init__ method with the provided path, path_hierarchy, and model_name. It then sets up the history attribute as an empty list and populates the methods attribute by invoking the get_methods_from_hierarchy function to extract method names from the hierarchy. Additionally, it calls the __set_contextualize_prompt and __set_classification_prompt functions internally to configure contextualized and classification prompts for chat interactions.

The get_methods_from_hierarchy function is crucial in extracting method names from the hierarchy dictionary and populating the methods attribute. This function ensures that the ClassificationModel object is initialized with relevant method names for further processing.

The __set_contextualize_prompt function prepares a contextualized question prompt by incorporating system prompts, chat history placeholders, and user input placeholders. This facilitates meaningful interactions within a chat context by contextualizing user questions based on the ongoing conversation.

Similarly, the __set_classification_prompt function sets up a prompt template for classification prompts using predefined examples. By creating a prompt template and example selector, this function enables the model to handle classification scenarios effectively during interactions.

**Note**:
Developers utilizing the __init__ method should ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly populated to extract method names accurately. It is essential to understand the role of each internal function (__set_contextualize_prompt and __set_classification_prompt) in setting up prompts for chat interactions to enhance user engagement and conversation flow.

If the hierarchy dictionary contains the following structure:
```python
{
    "key1": [
        {"name": "method1"},
        {"name": "method2"}
    ],
    "key2": [
        {"name": "method3"}
    ]
}
```
The function get_methods_from_hierarchy will return:
```python
["method1", "method2", "method3"]
```
