**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as the function operates on the hierarchy attribute of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The get_methods_from_hierarchy function iterates over the keys of the hierarchy dictionary. For each key, it retrieves the list of items associated with that key. It then extracts the "name" attribute from each item and appends it to the methods list. Finally, it returns the list of method names.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the __init__ method of the ClassificationModel class. Upon initialization of a ClassificationModel object, the get_methods_from_hierarchy function is invoked to populate the methods attribute with the extracted method names from the hierarchy dictionary. This allows the object to have access to the list of methods associated with the hierarchy.

**Note**: 
It is essential to ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid any potential errors related to accessing keys or items in the dictionary.

**Output Example**: 
If the hierarchy dictionary contains the following structure:
{
    "key1": [{"name": "method1"}, {"name": "method2"}],
    "key2": [{"name": "method3"}]
}

The output of get_methods_from_hierarchy would be:
["method1", "method2", "method3"]
