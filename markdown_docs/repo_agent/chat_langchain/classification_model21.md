### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ClassificationModel object with specific attributes and set up contextualized and classification prompts.

**parameters**:
- path: Represents the path of the model.
- path_hierarchy: Indicates the hierarchy of the path.
- model_name: Specifies the name of the model.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function initializes the ClassificationModel object by calling the superclass constructor with the provided path, path_hierarchy, and model_name. It then initializes the history attribute as an empty list. Next, it invokes the get_methods_from_hierarchy function to populate the methods attribute with method names extracted from the hierarchy. Additionally, it calls the __set_contextualize_prompt and __set_classification_prompt functions to set up contextualized and classification prompts, respectively.

The get_methods_from_hierarchy function extracts method names from the hierarchy dictionary, enabling the object to access a list of methods for further processing. The __set_contextualize_prompt function constructs a contextualized question prompt by combining system prompts, chat history, and user input. On the other hand, the __set_classification_prompt function prepares a prompt template for classification prompts based on a list of examples.

The __init__ function plays a crucial role in initializing a ClassificationModel object with necessary attributes and setting up prompts for accurate user query interpretation within the chat context.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly initialized before calling the get_methods_from_hierarchy function.
- The __set_contextualize_prompt and __set_classification_prompt functions are essential for enhancing the model's ability to process user queries accurately within the chat context.

### FunctionDef get_methods_from_hierarchy(self)
**get_methods_from_hierarchy**: The function of get_methods_from_hierarchy is to extract method names from a hierarchy dictionary and return them as a list.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as the function operates on the hierarchy attribute of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The get_methods_from_hierarchy function iterates over the keys of the hierarchy dictionary, then iterates over the list of items for each key. It extracts the "name" key from each item and appends it to the methods list. Finally, it returns the list of method names.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the __init__ method of the ClassificationModel class. When an instance of ClassificationModel is initialized, the get_methods_from_hierarchy function is invoked to populate the methods attribute with the extracted method names from the hierarchy dictionary. This allows the object to have access to the list of methods for further processing.

**Note**: 
- This function assumes a specific structure for the hierarchy dictionary, where each key contains a list of items with a "name" key.
- Ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid errors.

**Output Example**: 
If the hierarchy dictionary contains the following structure:
{
    "key1": [{"name": "method1"}, {"name": "method2"}],
    "key2": [{"name": "method3"}]
}

The function will return:
["method1", "method2", "method3"]

### FunctionDef get_classification(self, question)
**get_classification**: The function of get_classification is to classify a given question based on the presence of specific methods, generate a standalone question if needed, and return the classification.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- question: A string representing the question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_classification function first calls the classify_trought_name method to check if the question contains any specific methods. If a method is found, it prints the classification and returns it. If no method is found, it generates a standalone question using the __generate_standalone_question method, prompts the user for input, and returns a generic classification. The function handles the classification process based on the presence of methods in the question.

In the context of the project, get_classification serves as the main function to determine the type of question being asked, whether it is specific or generic. It utilizes the classify_trought_name method to identify specific methods in the question and __generate_standalone_question to create a standalone question when needed.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the classify_trought_name and __generate_standalone_question methods are correctly implemented and accessible within the class.
- The function assumes a specific format for methods and questions to classify them accurately.

**Output Example**:
If a specific method is found in the question:
"specific"

If no specific method is found:
"generic"
***
### FunctionDef classify_trought_name(self, question)
The function of classify_trought_name is to check if a given question contains any method from a list of methods. If a method is found in the question, it returns '\n specific'; otherwise, it returns an empty string.

**Parameters**:
- question: A string representing the question to be analyzed.

**Code Description**:
The classify_trought_name function iterates through a list of methods and checks if any method is present in the given question. If a method is found, it returns '\n specific' indicating a specific question. If no method is found, it returns an empty string.

In the calling object get_classification, the classify_trought_name function is used to classify the type of question. If the question is specific (contains a method), it prints the classification and returns it. Otherwise, it generates a standalone question, prompts the user for input, and returns a generic classification.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the list of methods is appropriately defined before calling this function.
- The function assumes that the methods are keywords that uniquely identify specific types of questions.

**Output Example**:
If the question contains a method:
'\n specific'

If the question does not contain any method:
''

### FunctionDef __set_contextualize_prompt(self)
**__set_contextualize_prompt**: The function of __set_contextualize_prompt is to set up a contextualized question prompt by combining system prompts, chat history, and the latest user input to enhance the classification model's ability to interpret user queries accurately within the chat context.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The __set_contextualize_prompt function initializes the contextualize_q_prompt attribute of the ClassificationModel class by creating a ChatPromptTemplate. This template is formed by incorporating a system prompt generated by the get_contextualize_q_system_prompt function, the chat history, and the latest user input. By structuring these elements together, the function ensures that the classification model can process user queries effectively within the context of the ongoing conversation.

The get_contextualize_q_system_prompt function, which is called within __set_contextualize_prompt, plays a crucial role in formulating clear and context-independent questions. By combining the system prompt with relevant chat history and user input, the function contributes to the overall accuracy and relevance of the contextualized prompts used in the classification model.

**Note**: The __set_contextualize_prompt function is an integral part of preparing contextualized question prompts that enable the classification model to understand and respond to user queries accurately within the context of a conversation. It relies on the get_contextualize_q_system_prompt function to generate clear and context-independent system prompts, enhancing the model's performance.
