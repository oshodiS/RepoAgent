## ClassDef SpecificModel
**SpecificModel**: The function of SpecificModel is to create a specific model instance tailored for the chat_langchain project.

**Attributes**:
- `path`: The path to the model.
- `path_hierarchy`: The path to the hierarchy file.
- `model_name`: The name of the model.
- `chunk_size`: The size of the data chunks.
- `chunk_overlap`: The overlap between data chunks.

**Code Description**:
The `SpecificModel` class is a specialized model class that extends the base `Model` class. It initializes the object with the provided parameters and loads documents from the specified path. The vector store is set based on the chunk size and overlap, and a retriever is created for self-query retrieval. Additionally, it sets up the chain for processing chat messages.

The `set_chain` method is responsible for setting up the chat history and QA system prompts, creating prompt templates, and establishing the runnable chain for message processing.

The `get_docs` method returns the loaded documents associated with the model.

**Note**:
- The `SpecificModel` class is designed for specific model functionalities within the chat_langchain project.
- It utilizes the base functionality provided by the `Model` class and extends it for specialized purposes.

**Output Example**:
```python
specific_model = SpecificModel(path, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
docs = specific_model.get_docs()
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the SpecificModel object with essential parameters and configurations.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the model.
- path_hierarchy: The hierarchy of the path.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of each data chunk.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between data chunks.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ method of the SpecificModel class initializes the object by loading documents from the specified path using the utilities.load_docs function. It then sets up a vector store by calling the set_vectorstore method with the provided chunk_size, chunk_overlap, and a collection name. Additionally, it configures metadata field information and creates a retriever for self-query retrieval based on the provided information. Finally, the method sets up the question-answering chain by invoking the set_chain function.

The set_vectorstore method is crucial for preparing the data for the model by splitting documents into chunks and creating a vector store. The set_chain function establishes the question-answering chain within the model context, enabling it to process queries effectively.

**Note**:
- Adjust the chunk_size and chunk_overlap parameters according to the model's requirements.
- Ensure the path provided contains the necessary documents for loading.
- Properly configure the metadata field information for accurate retrieval.
- Provide meaningful names for the model and collection to maintain clarity and organization in the system.

### FunctionDef set_chain(self)
**set_chain**: The function of set_chain is to initialize the chain for question answering by creating prompt templates based on the question-answer prompt, history prompt, and retriever.

**parameters**:
- This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The set_chain function first retrieves a system prompt for chat interactions using the get_dont_contextualize_system_prompt function. It then obtains a specific prompt for question-answering tasks through the get_qa_system_prompt function. Subsequently, the function calls the create_runnable_chain method from the Model class to construct a runnable chain for question answering. The chain is created using the retrieved question-answer prompt, history prompt, and the retriever object. The function sets the constructed chain to the 'chain' attribute of the object, enabling it to facilitate question-answering processes within the specific model context.

In the project structure, the set_chain function is invoked within the __init__ method of the SpecificModel class. This method is responsible for initializing various components of the specific model, including loading documentation, setting up a vector store, configuring metadata field information, creating a retriever, and ultimately setting up the question-answering chain using the set_chain function.

**Note**:
Developers should ensure that appropriate prompts and a retriever object are provided before calling the set_chain function to establish a functional question-answering chain within the specific model context.

### FunctionDef get_docs(self)
**get_docs**: The function of get_docs is to return the value of the "docs" attribute stored in the object.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The get_docs function simply returns the value of the "docs" attribute that is stored in the object.

**Note**: It is important to ensure that the "docs" attribute is properly set before calling this function to avoid any potential errors related to the attribute not being initialized.

**Output Example**: 
If the "docs" attribute in the object is set to "Sample documentation", calling get_docs() will return "Sample documentation".
