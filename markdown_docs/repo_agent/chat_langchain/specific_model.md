## ClassDef SpecificModel
**SpecificModel**: The function of SpecificModel is to handle specific functionalities within the chat language chain system.

**attributes**:
- path: Represents the path to the markdown files.
- path_hierarchy: Represents the path to the hierarchy.
- model_name: Specifies the name of the model.
- chunk_size: Indicates the size of the document chunks.
- chunk_overlap: Represents the overlap between document chunks.
- docs: Holds the loaded documents.
- metadata_field_info: Contains information about metadata fields.
- retriever: Manages self-query retrieval.
- chain: Represents the chat language chain.

**Code Description**:
The SpecificModel class extends the Model class and initializes with path, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, and chunk_overlap parameters. It loads documents using utilities.load_docs, sets up a vector store, and creates a retriever for self-query retrieval. The set_chain method sets up the chat chain by creating prompt templates and runnable chains.

The get_docs method returns the loaded documents. This class plays a crucial role in managing specific functionalities within the chat language chain system, such as handling document retrieval and chat interactions.

The SpecificModel class is called within the ChatRepo class to handle specific tasks related to the chat language chain system. It interacts with utilities functions to load documents, set up retrievers, and manage chat chains effectively.

**Note**: Ensure to provide the necessary parameters when initializing the SpecificModel class to enable its functionalities effectively within the chat language chain system.

**Output Example**:
```python
specific_model = SpecificModel("path/to/markdown", "path/to/hierarchy", "model_name", 1000, 100)
docs = specific_model.get_docs()
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the SpecificModel object by loading documents, setting up a vector store, creating a retriever, and establishing a chat message processing chain.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the directory containing the documents.
- path_hierarchy: The hierarchy of the path.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of each chunk for document splitting.
- chunk_overlap: The number of characters to overlap between consecutive chunks.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function first calls the parent class' initialization method to set the path, path_hierarchy, and model_name. It then loads documents using the load_docs function from utilities. Next, it sets up a vector store by calling the set_vectorstore function with the specified chunk_size, chunk_overlap, and a collection name. The function then defines metadata_field_info for document attributes and creates a retriever using SelfQueryRetriever. Finally, it invokes the set_chain function to establish a chat message processing chain within the SpecificModel context.

The set_vectorstore function is crucial for preparing the data for downstream processing, while the set_chain function plays a vital role in structuring the chat message processing flow. The __init__ method orchestrates the initialization steps required for SpecificModel, ensuring the seamless processing of chat interactions within the defined model context.

**Note**:
- Adjust the chunk_size and chunk_overlap parameters as needed for document splitting.
- Provide meaningful metadata_field_info for document attribute information.
- Understand the interplay between loading documents, setting up the vector store, creating a retriever, and establishing the chat processing chain for effective chat message handling within SpecificModel.

### FunctionDef set_chain(self)
**set_chain**: The function of set_chain is to establish a chat message processing chain by creating prompt templates for question-answer interactions and chat history, and then constructing a retrieval chain using these prompts along with a retriever object.

**parameters**:
- This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The set_chain function first retrieves a system prompt for chat history from the get_dont_contextualize_system_prompt function and a prompt for question-answer interactions from the get_qa_system_prompt function. It then utilizes the create_runnable_chain function from the Model class to generate a runnable chain incorporating the retrieved prompts and the retriever object. By doing so, it sets up a structured flow within the chat processing chain, ensuring effective handling of chat messages within the SpecificModel context.

This function is called within the __init__ method of the SpecificModel class to initialize the chat message processing chain along with other essential components such as document loading, vector store configuration, and retriever creation. The set_chain function plays a crucial role in preparing the SpecificModel object for processing chat interactions seamlessly within the defined model context.

**Note**:
- The set_chain function relies on the create_runnable_chain function to create a functional chat message processing chain.
- Ensure valid prompts and a retriever object are provided to set up the chat processing chain effectively.
- Understanding the interaction between set_chain and create_runnable_chain is essential for comprehending the flow of chat message processing within the SpecificModel class.

### FunctionDef get_docs(self)
**get_docs**: The function of get_docs is to return the value of the "docs" attribute stored in the object.

**parameters**: 
This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The get_docs Function is a simple method that retrieves and returns the value of the "docs" attribute from the object it is called on.

**Note**: 
Developers using this Function should ensure that the "docs" attribute is properly set before calling get_docs to avoid any potential errors related to the attribute not being initialized.

**Output Example**: 
If the "docs" attribute in the object is set to "Sample documentation", calling get_docs will return the string "Sample documentation".
