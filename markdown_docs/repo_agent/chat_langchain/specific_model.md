## ClassDef SpecificModel
**SpecificModel**: The function of SpecificModel is to create a specialized model for chat language chain operations with specific functionalities.

**attributes**:
- path: The path to the model.
- path_hierarchy: The path to the hierarchy.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of the document chunks.
- chunk_overlap: The overlap between document chunks.
- metadata_field_info: Information about metadata fields.
- retriever: A retriever object for self-querying.
- docs: Holds the loaded documents.

**Code Description**:
The SpecificModel class extends the Model class and initializes with the provided parameters. It loads documents from the specified path, sets up a vector store, and creates a retriever for self-querying. The set_chain method is responsible for setting up the chat language chain. The load_docs method loads documents from the path. The get_docs method returns the loaded documents.

The SpecificModel class is part of the chat language chain project and is called within the ChatRepo class in the chat.py file to create a specific model instance for chunking documents. It interacts with the Model class for foundational functionalities and is utilized in the show_chunk function in the main.py file to demonstrate document chunking.

**Note**: Ensure to provide necessary parameters when initializing the SpecificModel class to enable its functionalities effectively. The class is designed to work in conjunction with other components of the chat language chain project.

**Output Example**:
```python
specific_model = SpecificModel("path/to/model", "path/to/hierarchy", "model_name", 500, 50)
specific_model.set_chain()
loaded_docs = specific_model.get_docs()
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name, chunk_size, chunk_overlap)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the SpecificModel object by setting up the necessary attributes, loading documents from a specified directory, configuring a vector store, creating a retriever object, and establishing a chat message processing chain.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the directory containing the documents.
- path_hierarchy: The hierarchy of paths within the directory.
- model_name: The name of the model.
- chunk_size: The size of each chunk for document splitting.
- chunk_overlap: The number of characters to overlap between consecutive chunks.

**Code Description**:
The __init__ function first calls the parent class's initialization method to set the path, path_hierarchy, and model_name attributes. It then loads the documents from the specified path using the load_docs method. Next, it configures the vector store by calling the set_vectorstore method inherited from the Model class, passing the chunk_size, chunk_overlap, and a specific collection name. 

Following this, the function initializes metadata_field_info with information about the 'source' attribute. It then creates a retriever object using SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm, providing the necessary parameters such as the llm model, vectorstore, metadata field information, and verbosity setting. Finally, the function sets up the chat message processing chain by calling the set_chain method.

In the project structure, the __init__ function is a crucial part of initializing the SpecificModel class within the chat_langchain module. It orchestrates the setup of document loading, vector store configuration, retriever creation, and chat message processing chain establishment. By executing these steps, the function prepares the SpecificModel object for handling chat messages effectively within the defined model context.

**Note**:
- Ensure to provide valid paths and model names when initializing the SpecificModel object.
- Adjust the chunk_size and chunk_overlap parameters based on the desired document splitting configuration.
- Understand the sequence of operations within the __init__ function to grasp the overall setup process of the SpecificModel class for chat message processing.

### FunctionDef set_chain(self)
**set_chain**: The function of set_chain is to initialize the chat message processing chain by creating prompt templates for contextualizing questions and question-answer interactions, and setting up a retrieval chain.

**parameters**:
- This function does not take any parameters explicitly defined within its scope.

**Code Description**:
The set_chain function first retrieves the system prompts for contextualizing questions and question-answer interactions using the utilities.get_contextualize_q_system_prompt and utilities.get_qa_system_prompt functions, respectively. It then calls the create_runnable_chain method from the Model class to construct a chain for processing chat messages. This chain includes components such as contextualize_q_system_prompt, qa_system_prompt, and a retriever object. By utilizing these components, the function establishes a structured flow for handling chat messages effectively within the conversation chain.

In the project structure, set_chain is called within the __init__ method of the SpecificModel class. This method is responsible for setting up the entire model, loading necessary documents, configuring vector stores, initializing metadata field information, creating a retriever object, and finally, initializing the chat message processing chain through set_chain.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the necessary prompts and retriever object are properly set up before calling set_chain.
- The function plays a crucial role in establishing the message flow and structure of the conversation chain for processing chat messages efficiently within the SpecificModel class.

### FunctionDef load_docs(self)
**load_docs**: The function of load_docs is to load all documents from a specified directory using a DirectoryLoader and store them in the object's 'docs' attribute.

**parameters**:
- self: The object itself.

**Code Description**:
The load_docs function iterates through all subdirectories in the specified path using os.walk. For each subdirectory, it creates a DirectoryLoader instance with the path, a specific file extension pattern (glob), and a loader class. It then loads the documents using the loader and appends them to the 'all_docs' list. Finally, it assigns the 'all_docs' list to the object's 'docs' attribute.

In the calling situation, the load_docs function is called within the __init__ method of the SpecificModel class. After initializing some attributes and calling the parent class's set_vectorstore method, load_docs is invoked to load all documents from the specified path. This step is crucial for setting up the object with the necessary document data before further processing.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the 'path' attribute of the object is correctly set before calling load_docs to load documents from the intended directory.
- The documents loaded by this function will be stored in the 'docs' attribute of the object for subsequent use within the model.
***
### FunctionDef get_docs(self)
**get_docs**: The function of get_docs is to return the value of the "docs" attribute stored in the object.

**parameters**: 
This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The get_docs Function is a simple method that retrieves and returns the value of the "docs" attribute from the object it is called on.

**Note**: 
Developers using this Function should ensure that the "docs" attribute is properly set before calling get_docs to avoid any potential errors related to the attribute not being initialized.

**Output Example**: 
If the "docs" attribute in the object is set to "Sample documentation", calling get_docs will return the string "Sample documentation".
