## ClassDef ClassificationModel
**ClassificationModel**: The function of ClassificationModel is to provide a model for classifying user questions into general or specific categories based on predefined prompts and methods.

**Attributes**:
- `history`: A list to store the history of user interactions.
- `methods`: A list of methods extracted from the hierarchy.
- `contextualize_q_prompt`: A chat prompt template for contextualizing questions.
- `prompt`: A prompt template for classification based on examples.

**Code Description**:
The `ClassificationModel` class extends the `Model` class and initializes the object with a path, path hierarchy, and model name. It sets up the history list, extracts methods from the hierarchy, and configures contextualize and classification prompts.

The `get_methods_from_hierarchy` method retrieves methods from the hierarchy for classification purposes.

The `get_classification` method classifies user questions into general or specific categories based on predefined prompts and methods.

The `classify_trought_name` method checks if a method is mentioned in the question for specific classification.

The `__set_contextualize_prompt` method sets up a chat prompt template for contextualizing questions.

The `__add_to_history` method manages the history of user interactions.

The `__generate_standalone_question` method generates a standalone question for classification.

The `__set_classification_prompt` method configures a prompt template for classification based on predefined examples.

**Note**: The `ClassificationModel` class is designed to classify user questions into general or specific categories using predefined prompts and methods.

**Output Example**:
```python
model = ClassificationModel(path="path/to/model", path_hierarchy="path/to/hierarchy", model_name="model")
classification = model.get_classification(question="How does this function work?")
```
### FunctionDef __init__(self, path, path_hierarchy, model_name)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the ClassificationModel object with specific attributes and configurations.

**parameters**:
- path: The path to the model.
- path_hierarchy: The hierarchical structure of the model.
- model_name: The name of the model.

**Code Description**: 
The __init__ function initializes the ClassificationModel object by calling the superclass constructor with the provided path, path_hierarchy, and model_name. It then sets up the history attribute as an empty list, retrieves methods from the hierarchy using the get_methods_from_hierarchy function, and configures contextualized and classification prompts using __set_contextualize_prompt and __set_classification_prompt functions respectively.

The get_methods_from_hierarchy function is utilized to extract method names from the hierarchy attribute, enabling the object to access a list of methods defined in the hierarchy. The __set_contextualize_prompt function prepares a contextualized prompt for user questions within a chat context, while the __set_classification_prompt function sets up a prompt template for classification prompts based on examples.

These functions collectively ensure that the ClassificationModel object is initialized with necessary attributes and prompt templates for handling user interactions and classification tasks within a chat context.

**Note**: 
Ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly initialized before calling the get_methods_from_hierarchy function. Additionally, developers should review the prompt templates generated by __set_contextualize_prompt and __set_classification_prompt to ensure they align with the requirements of contextualizing user questions and facilitating classification prompts effectively.

### FunctionDef get_methods_from_hierarchy(self)
**get_methods_from_hierarchy**: The function of get_methods_from_hierarchy is to extract method names from a hierarchical structure and return them as a list.

**parameters**: 
- No parameters are passed explicitly, as the function operates on the hierarchy attribute of the object.

**Code Description**: 
The get_methods_from_hierarchy function iterates over the keys of the hierarchy dictionary, then iterates over the items in the corresponding list. It extracts the "name" key from each item and appends it to the methods list. Finally, it returns the list of method names.

In the context of the project, this function is called within the __init__ method of the ClassificationModel class. When an instance of ClassificationModel is created, the get_methods_from_hierarchy function is invoked to populate the methods attribute with the extracted method names from the hierarchy. This allows the ClassificationModel object to have access to the list of methods defined in the hierarchy.

**Note**: 
It is essential to ensure that the hierarchy attribute is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid any potential errors related to accessing keys in an empty dictionary.

**Output Example**: 
If the hierarchy attribute contains the following structure:
```python
{
    "class1": [
        {"name": "method1"},
        {"name": "method2"}
    ],
    "class2": [
        {"name": "method3"},
        {"name": "method4"}
    ]
}
```
The function get_methods_from_hierarchy will return:
```python
["method1", "method2", "method3", "method4"]
```

### FunctionDef get_classification(self, question)
**get_classification**: The function of get_classification is to classify the input question based on specific criteria and return the classification.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- question: A string representing the input question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The get_classification function first calls the classify_trought_name method to classify the input question. If the classification is '\n specific', it prints the classification and returns it. Otherwise, it generates a standalone question using the __generate_standalone_question method, prompts the user, and returns "specific". This function interacts with other methods within the ClassificationModel class to handle the classification process based on the input question.

**Note**:
Developers can customize the behavior of the classification by adjusting the logic within the get_classification method according to their requirements.

**Output Example**:
If the input question contains a method from the list of methods:
'\n specific'

If the input question does not contain any method from the list:
'specific'
***
### FunctionDef classify_trought_name(self, question)
The function of classify_trought_name is to check if any method from a list of methods is present in the input question and return a specific string if a match is found.

**parameters**:
- question: A string representing the input question to be classified.

**Code Description**:
The classify_trought_name function iterates through a list of methods and checks if any method is present in the input question. If a method is found in the question, it returns the string '\n specific'. Otherwise, it returns an empty string.

This function is utilized within the get_classification method of the ClassificationModel class. In the get_classification method, the classify_trought_name function is called to classify the input question. If the returned classification is '\n specific', the method prints the classification and returns it. Otherwise, it generates a standalone question, prompts the user, and returns "specific".

**Note**:
Developers can modify the list of methods in the ClassificationModel class to customize the classification process based on their specific requirements.

**Output Example**:
If the input question contains a method from the list of methods:
'\n specific'

If the input question does not contain any method from the list:
''
***
### FunctionDef __set_contextualize_prompt(self)
**__set_contextualize_prompt**: The function of __set_contextualize_prompt is to set up a contextualized prompt for user questions within a chat context.

**parameters**: 
This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The __set_contextualize_prompt function initializes the contextualize_q_prompt attribute of the object by creating a ChatPromptTemplate from a series of messages. These messages include a system prompt generated by the get_contextualize_q_system_prompt function, a placeholder for chat history, and the latest user question. This setup ensures that the user question is contextualized within the chat history for further interactions.

The get_contextualize_q_system_prompt function, called within this method, formulates a standalone question based on a chat history and the latest user question. It focuses on ensuring the question can be understood independently without the need for additional context, answers, requests for more information, or clarifications beyond the original question.

In the project structure, this function is called within the __init__ method of the ClassificationModel class to prepare prompts for contextualizing user questions and facilitating classification tasks.

**Note**: 
Developers utilizing this function should ensure that the generated prompt effectively contextualizes user questions within the chat history. It is crucial to follow the guidelines provided by the get_contextualize_q_system_prompt function to maintain the standalone nature of the question without introducing unnecessary information or seeking additional context beyond the original query.

### FunctionDef __add_to_history(self, user_input, system_output, max_history_length)
**__add_to_history**: The function of __add_to_history is to add user input and system output to the history list with a maximum length constraint.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- user_input: The input provided by the user.
- system_output: The output generated by the system.
- max_history_length: The maximum length of the history list (default value is 3).

**Code Description**:
The __add_to_history function first checks if the length of the history list is greater than or equal to twice the max_history_length. If so, it removes the oldest entry from the history list. Then, it appends a dictionary containing the role ("user" or "system") and the content (user input or system output) to the history list.

This function is called by the __generate_standalone_question function in the same class. In the __generate_standalone_question function, a new LLMChain instance is created, and the run method is called with the chat_history parameter set to self.history and the input parameter set to user_input. After obtaining the standalone question, the __add_to_history function is called to add the user input and standalone question to the history list.

**Note**:
It is important to ensure that the max_history_length parameter is set appropriately to control the size of the history list and manage memory usage effectively.
***
### FunctionDef __generate_standalone_question(self, user_input)
**__generate_standalone_question**: The function of __generate_standalone_question is to generate a standalone question based on the user input and update the conversation history.

**parameters**:
- self: The instance of the class.
- user_input: The input provided by the user.

**Code Description**:
The __generate_standalone_question function initializes an LLMChain instance with the provided language model and contextual prompt. It then runs the chain with the chat history from the class instance and the user input. The resulting standalone question is stored in the history by calling the __add_to_history function with the user input and standalone question. Finally, the standalone question is returned.

This function interacts with the __add_to_history function within the same class to maintain a history of user inputs and system outputs. By utilizing the LLMChain instance, it processes the user input to generate a relevant standalone question for the conversation.

**Note**:
It is crucial to set an appropriate max_history_length parameter to manage the size of the history list effectively and optimize memory usage.

**Output Example**:
"Can you provide more details about your query?"
***
### FunctionDef __set_classification_prompt(self)
**__set_classification_prompt**: The function of __set_classification_prompt is to set up a prompt template for classification prompts based on a list of examples.

**parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**: The __set_classification_prompt function initializes a list of examples containing questions and answers. It then creates a prompt template using the PromptTemplate class with input variables "question" and "answer". Next, it sets up a SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector using the examples, OpenAIEmbeddings, Chroma, and a value k. Finally, it creates a FewShotPromptTemplate with the example selector, example prompt, suffix, and input variables, and assigns it to the prompt attribute of the object.

This function is called within the __init__ method of the ClassificationModel class. When an instance of ClassificationModel is created, the __set_classification_prompt function is automatically executed to set up the prompt for classification prompts.

**Note**: Ensure that the examples list contains the necessary questions and answers for the classification prompts. Make sure to adjust the input variables and template in the PromptTemplate class based on the requirements of the classification prompts.

**Output Example**:
```python
prompt = {
    "input_variables": ["question", "answer"],
    "template": "{answer}"
}
```
