## ClassDef Runner
**Runner**: The Runner class is responsible for generating and updating documentation for the target repository. It initializes various components such as ProjectManager, ChangeDetector, and ChatEngine to perform the documentation generation process. It also handles the detection of changes in the repository and updates the documentation accordingly.

**Attributes**:
- `absolute_project_hierarchy_path`: A string representing the absolute path of the project hierarchy.
- `project_manager`: An instance of the ProjectManager class responsible for managing the project hierarchy.
- `change_detector`: An instance of the ChangeDetector class used to detect changes in the repository.
- `chat_engine`: An instance of the ChatEngine class used for generating documentation using a chat-based approach.
- `meta_info`: An instance of the MetaInfo class representing the meta information of the documentation.
- `runner_lock`: A threading.Lock object used for thread synchronization.

**Code Description**:
The Runner class is the main class responsible for generating and updating documentation for the target repository. It initializes various components and handles the detection of changes in the repository.

The `__init__` method initializes the Runner object by setting the `absolute_project_hierarchy_path` attribute to the target repository's project hierarchy path. It also initializes the `project_manager`, `change_detector`, and `chat_engine` objects using the appropriate parameters.

The `get_all_pys` method is used to retrieve all Python files in a given directory. It takes a directory path as an argument and returns a list of paths to all Python files found in the directory.

The `generate_doc_for_a_single_item` method is responsible for generating documentation for a single object. It takes a `doc_item` parameter of type DocItem and generates the documentation using the `chat_engine` object. The generated documentation is then appended to the `md_content` attribute of the `doc_item` object.

The `first_generate` method is used to generate all the documentation for the target repository. It checks if the generation process is already in progress and initializes a new task list if not. It then generates the documentation for each object in the task list using multiple threads. After the generation process is completed, it updates the `document_version` attribute of the `meta_info` object and writes the updated meta information to the file system.

The `markdown_refresh` method is responsible for writing the latest document information to a folder in markdown format. It deletes the existing markdown folder and creates a new one. It then iterates over all the file items in the `meta_info` object and converts the content to markdown format. The markdown content is then written to the corresponding `.md` file.

The `git_commit` method is used to commit the changes made during the documentation generation process. It takes a `commit_message` parameter and uses the `subprocess` module to execute the git commit command.

The `run` method is the main entry point for the documentation update process. It detects changes in the repository, processes each changed file, and updates the documentation accordingly. It first checks if the generation process is already in progress. If not, it starts the detection process by creating a new project hierarchy and merging it with the old hierarchy. It then generates or updates the documentation for each changed file using multiple threads. After the process is completed, it updates the `document_version` attribute of the `meta_info` object and writes the updated meta information to the file system. It also calls the `markdown_refresh` method to update the markdown documents.

**Note**: During the documentation generation process, the target repository code should not be modified as the generation process is bound to a specific version of the code.

**Output Example**: N/A
### FunctionDef __init__(self)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the Runner class with necessary configurations and components for project management, change detection, chat-based documentation generation, and metadata handling.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `__init__` method of the Runner class is designed to set up the environment for running documentation and change detection tasks within a repository. It performs several critical initializations as follows:

- Initializes the `absolute_project_hierarchy_path` by combining the target repository path and the project hierarchy name from the settings. This path is used to locate or create the project hierarchy folder within the repository.
- Creates an instance of `ProjectManager` with the repository path and project hierarchy name. The `ProjectManager` is responsible for managing the project's structure and hierarchy.
- Initializes a `ChangeDetector` instance with the repository path. The `ChangeDetector` is tasked with identifying file changes within the repository since the last commit.
- Sets up a `ChatEngine` instance by passing the `ProjectManager` instance to it. The `ChatEngine` is used for generating documentation based on code changes and project structure.
- Checks if the `absolute_project_hierarchy_path` exists. If it does not, it means the project hierarchy needs to be created. In this case, it calls `make_fake_files` to generate fake files and initializes the `MetaInfo` object with file path reflections and jump files. It then saves this metadata information to the specified directory. If the project hierarchy folder already exists, it loads the `MetaInfo` from the checkpoint path.
- Regardless of whether the project hierarchy was just created or loaded, it updates the metadata checkpoint to ensure the latest state is saved.
- Initializes a threading lock named `runner_lock` to ensure thread safety during operations that modify shared resources.

**Note**: The `__init__` method is crucial for setting up the Runner class with all the necessary components for managing project documentation and detecting changes. It ensures that the environment is correctly initialized before performing any operations. The method handles both the scenario where the project hierarchy needs to be created and where it already exists, making it adaptable to different states of the repository. The inclusion of threading lock (`runner_lock`) highlights the consideration for concurrent operations, ensuring the integrity of shared resources.

### FunctionDef get_all_pys(self, directory)
**get_all_pys**: The function of get_all_pys is to retrieve all Python files within a specified directory.

**parameters**:
- directory: A string representing the directory path to search for Python files.

**Code Description**:
The get_all_pys function utilizes the os.walk method to traverse through the directory and its subdirectories. It checks each file encountered, and if the file has a ".py" extension, it appends the full path to the python_files list. Finally, it returns a list containing paths to all Python files found in the specified directory.

**Note**:
Ensure that the directory path provided is valid and accessible. The function only searches for files with a ".py" extension.

**Output Example**:
['/path/to/file1.py', '/path/to/file2.py', ...]
***
### FunctionDef generate_doc_for_a_single_item(self, doc_item)
**generate_doc_for_a_single_item**: The `generate_doc_for_a_single_item` function is responsible for generating documentation for a given `DocItem` object. It takes the `doc_item` parameter, which represents the documentation item to be generated. The function first checks if the documentation needs to be generated for the `doc_item` by calling the `need_to_generate` function. If the documentation is not required, the function prints a message indicating that the content is ignored or the document is already generated, and the function execution is skipped. 

If the documentation needs to be generated, the function proceeds to generate the document by calling the `generate_doc` function of the `ChatEngine` object. It passes the `doc_item` and a `FileHandler` object as parameters to the `generate_doc` function. The `FileHandler` object is responsible for reading and writing files.

The response message from the `generate_doc` function is then appended to the `md_content` attribute of the `doc_item` object. The `item_status` attribute of the `doc_item` is set to `DocItemStatus.doc_up_to_date` to indicate that the documentation is up to date. 

Finally, the function calls the `checkpoint` method of the `meta_info` object to save the updated information to the project hierarchy.

**Parameters**:
- `doc_item` (DocItem): The `DocItem` object representing the documentation item to be generated.

**Code Description**:
The `generate_doc_for_a_single_item` function begins by checking if the documentation needs to be generated for the given `doc_item`. It does this by calling the `need_to_generate` function, passing the `doc_item` and the `ignore_list` from the project settings. If the documentation is not required, the function prints a message indicating that the content is ignored or the document is already generated, and the function execution is skipped.

If the documentation needs to be generated, the function proceeds to call the `generate_doc` function of the `ChatEngine` object. It passes the `doc_item` and a `FileHandler` object as parameters to the `generate_doc` function. The `generate_doc` function is responsible for generating the documentation based on the provided `doc_item` and file information.

The response message from the `generate_doc` function is then appended to the `md_content` attribute of the `doc_item` object. This ensures that the generated documentation is stored for future reference.

The `item_status` attribute of the `doc_item` object is set to `DocItemStatus.doc_up_to_date` to indicate that the documentation is up to date.

Finally, the `checkpoint` method of the `meta_info` object is called to save the updated information to the project hierarchy. This ensures that the changes are persisted and can be retrieved later.

**Note**:
- The `generate_doc_for_a_single_item` function is an essential part of the documentation generation process. It determines whether the documentation needs to be generated for a given `DocItem` object and calls the appropriate functions to generate and store the documentation.
- Developers should ensure that the necessary configurations and settings are in place for the documentation generation process to work correctly.
- The accuracy and completeness of the generated documentation depend on the quality and structure of the codebase. It is recommended to review and validate the generated documentation to ensure its accuracy and usefulness.
***
### FunctionDef first_generate(self)
**first_generate**: The `first_generate` function is responsible for generating all the documents in the repository. It performs the document generation process in a specific order, synchronizes the generated documents back to the file system, and handles errors during the generation process.

**Parameters**:
- None

**Code Description**:
The `first_generate` function starts by logging an information message indicating the start of the document generation process. It then defines a partial function `check_task_available_func` by calling the `need_to_generate` function with the `ignore_list` parameter from the project settings.

Next, the function retrieves a `task_manager` object from the `meta_info` object by calling the `get_topology` method. The `get_topology` method calculates the topological order of all objects in the repository and generates a `TaskManager` object that manages the tasks based on the topology.

The function prints the task list using the `print_task_list` method of the `meta_info` object, which displays a table of task information including task ID, generation reason, path, and dependencies.

The function then sets the `sync_func` attribute of the `task_manager` object to the `markdown_refresh` function. This ensures that the `markdown_refresh` function is called after each task is completed.

The function creates multiple threads, each targeting the `worker` function. The `worker` function is responsible for performing tasks assigned by the `task_manager`. Each thread is assigned a unique process ID.

The threads are started and joined, ensuring that all tasks are completed before proceeding.

After the task generation process is completed, the function updates the `document_version` attribute of the `meta_info` object with the latest commit hash of the repository. It also sets the `in_generation_process` attribute to False and calls the `checkpoint` method of the `meta_info` object to save the updated information to the project hierarchy.

The function then logs an information message indicating the number of documents successfully generated.

Finally, the function checks if a README file exists in the target repository. If a README file is not found, it creates a `ParallelSummarizator` object and generates a summary using the `get_first_summarization` method. If a summary is generated, it is saved to a `summary.md` file in the `markdown_docs_name` directory of the target repository.

**Note**:
- The `first_generate` function is typically called when generating the initial set of documents for a repository.
- It generates documents in a specific order based on the topological order of the objects in the repository.
- The `need_to_generate` function is used to determine whether a document needs to be generated for a given object.
- The `markdown_refresh` function is responsible for updating the markdown documents based on the latest document information.
- The `worker` function performs tasks assigned by the `task_manager` in parallel.
- The `get_topology` method calculates the topological order of all objects in the repository and generates a `TaskManager` object.
- The `print_task_list` method displays a table of task information.
- The `checkpoint` method saves the updated information to the project hierarchy.
- The `ParallelSummarizator` class is used to generate summaries for the target repository.
- The `get_first_summarization` method loads documents from the specified path, splits them into chunks, processes them in parallel, and generates a single summary.

**Note**: During the `first_generate` process, it is important to ensure that the target repository code is not modified. The generation process must be bound to a specific version of the code to maintain consistency and accuracy in the generated documentation.
***
### FunctionDef markdown_refresh(self)
**markdown_refresh**: The function of markdown_refresh is to write the latest document information to a folder in markdown format, regardless of whether the markdown content has changed.

**Parameters**:
- `self`: The current object.

**Code Description**:
The `markdown_refresh` function is a method of the current object. It is responsible for updating the markdown documents based on the latest document information. The function performs the following steps:

1. Acquire a lock to ensure thread safety during the document generation process.
2. Delete the existing contents under the `doc` folder, if it exists.
3. Create a new `markdown_folder` to store the updated markdown documents.
4. Retrieve a list of all file items using the `get_all_files` method of the `meta_info` object.
5. Iterate through each file item in the list.
6. Check if there is any documentation inside the file by recursively traversing the file item's children using the `recursive_check` function.
7. If there is no documentation, skip the file and continue to the next iteration.
8. Get the relative file path of the file item.
9. Generate the markdown content for the file item and its children using the `to_markdown` function.
10. Write the markdown content to a `.md` file in the `markdown_folder` with the same name as the file item, replacing the `.py` extension with `.md`.
11. Log a message indicating that the markdown document has been refreshed at the specified location.

The `recursive_check` function is a helper function that checks if there is any documentation inside a given `DocItem`. It recursively traverses the children of the `DocItem` and checks if the `md_content` attribute is not empty. If any documentation is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `to_markdown` function is another helper function that generates the markdown content for a given `DocItem` and its children. It takes two parameters: `item`, which represents the current `DocItem`, and `now_level`, which represents the current level of the hierarchy. The function generates the markdown content by concatenating the appropriate headers, parameters (if any), and the last element of the `md_content` attribute of the `DocItem`. It then recursively generates the markdown content for each child of the `DocItem` and appends it to the current markdown content. Finally, it returns the complete markdown content.

**Note**:
- The function assumes that the `setting.project.target_repo` and `setting.project.markdown_docs_name` variables are properly configured.
- The function relies on the `shutil.rmtree` and `os.mkdir` functions to delete and create directories, respectively.
- The function uses the `tqdm` library to display a progress bar during the iteration over the file items.
- The function assumes that the `meta_info` object has a `get_all_files` method that returns a list of `DocItem` objects representing the file items in the repository.

**Output Example**: 
The markdown documents have been refreshed at the specified location.

Please note that the above description is based on the provided code and its usage within the project. It is important to understand the context and usage of this function within the project to fully comprehend its functionality.
#### FunctionDef recursive_check(doc_item)
**recursive_check**: The function of recursive_check is to check if there is a documentation content inside a file.

**parameters**:
- doc_item: Represents a documentation item within a repository.

**Code Description**: 
The recursive_check function takes a DocItem object as input and recursively checks if there is any Markdown content stored in the md_content attribute of the DocItem. If the md_content is not empty, the function returns True, indicating that documentation exists. Otherwise, it iterates through the children of the DocItem and recursively calls itself on each child until it finds documentation content or exhausts all children, in which case it returns False.

This function plays a crucial role in traversing the hierarchical structure of documentation items and determining the presence of documentation content within a file or its children.

**Note**:
- The recursive nature of this function allows for thorough exploration of the documentation hierarchy to ensure comprehensive coverage.
- It is designed to handle nested structures of documentation items and efficiently determine the existence of documentation content at different levels.

**Output Example**: 
- If documentation content is found within the file or its children, the function returns True.
- If no documentation content is found in the file or its children, the function returns False.
***
#### FunctionDef to_markdown(item, now_level)
**to_markdown**: The function of to_markdown is to generate markdown content for a given `DocItem` object and its children in a hierarchical manner.

**parameters**:
- `item` (DocItem): The `DocItem` object for which the markdown content needs to be generated.
- `now_level` (int): The current level of the `DocItem` object in the hierarchy.

**Code Description**:
The `to_markdown` function takes a `DocItem` object and its current level in the hierarchy as input. It generates markdown content for the given `DocItem` and its children by recursively traversing the hierarchy.

The function starts by initializing an empty string variable `markdown_content` to store the generated markdown content. It then appends the appropriate number of '#' characters based on the current level and adds the string representation of the `item_type` and `obj_name` of the `DocItem` object to the `markdown_content` string.

Next, the function checks if the `item` has any parameters by looking for the 'params' key in the `content` dictionary. If parameters are present, it appends them to the `markdown_content` string in a comma-separated format.

The function then adds a newline character to the `markdown_content` string and appends the last element of the `md_content` list of the `item` if it is not empty. If the `md_content` list is empty, it appends the string "Doc is waiting to be generated..." to indicate that the documentation is pending.

The function then iterates over the children of the `item` and recursively calls the `to_markdown` function for each child, incrementing the `now_level` by 1. It appends the generated markdown content for each child to the `markdown_content` string and adds a horizontal rule ('***') after each child.

Finally, the function returns the `markdown_content` string.

**Note**:
- The `to_markdown` function is designed to generate markdown content for a `DocItem` object and its children in a hierarchical manner.
- The function uses the `item_type` and `obj_name` attributes of the `DocItem` object to create the heading for the markdown content.
- The function checks if the `item` has parameters and includes them in the markdown content if present.
- The function handles the case when the `md_content` list of the `item` is empty and provides a placeholder message.
- The function recursively generates markdown content for the children of the `item` and adds horizontal rules between each child.

**git_commit**: The function of git_commit is to commit changes to a Git repository with a specified commit message.

**parameters**:
- commit_message: A string representing the message for the commit.

**Code Description**:
The git_commit function utilizes the subprocess module to execute a Git commit command with the provided commit message. It attempts to commit changes to the Git repository using the specified message. If the commit operation encounters an error, it catches the subprocess.CalledProcessError exception and prints an error message indicating the failure.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the commit_message parameter is provided with a meaningful message to describe the changes being committed.
- Handle any exceptions that may occur during the commit process to manage errors effectively.
***
### FunctionDef run(self)
**run**: The function of run is to execute the document update process for a Python project. This process involves detecting changed Python files, processing each file, and updating the documents accordingly.

**parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `run` method is a critical component of the documentation update process within a Python project. It orchestrates several steps to ensure that the documentation reflects the latest changes in the codebase. The method begins by checking if the `document_version` attribute of the `meta_info` object is empty, indicating that this might be the first generation of the documentation. If so, it calls the `first_generate` method to generate all documents from scratch and updates the project's meta information.

If the documentation generation process is not in its initial run, the method proceeds to detect changes in the Python files. It employs a new approach to create a new project hierarchy, merges it with the old hierarchy, and identifies the necessary updates. This includes generating documentation for new files, deleting documentation for removed files, and updating documentation for modified files or files affected by changes in reference relationships.

The method utilizes the `make_fake_files` function to handle files that have been modified but not staged for commit, treating them as "fake" files for the purpose of documentation generation. It then updates the `meta_info` object with the new meta information and marks the process as being in the generation phase.

A task manager is retrieved from the `meta_info` object, which manages the documentation tasks based on the project's hierarchy. The method iterates through deleted items from the older meta information, logging each deletion. It then prints the task list and checks if all tasks have been successfully completed. If not, it proceeds to generate documentation for each item in the task list using multiple threads.

After processing all tasks, the method updates the `document_version` with the latest commit hash, marks the generation process as complete, and saves the updated meta information. It then refreshes the markdown documentation and cleans up any fake files created during the process.

Finally, the method adds any unstaged documentation files to the staging area using the `add_unstaged_files` method from the `ChangeDetector` object and logs the completion of the documentation update process.

**Note**: 
- It is crucial to ensure that the project's meta information is accurately maintained and updated throughout the documentation generation process to reflect the current state of the codebase.
- The method employs a combination of file manipulation, task management, and multi-threading to efficiently update the documentation.
- The use of fake files allows the method to handle modifications in Python files that have not been committed, ensuring that the documentation is always synchronized with the latest changes in the codebase.

**Output Example**: Not applicable, as this method does not return a value but instead updates project documentation and meta information.
***
### FunctionDef add_new_item(self, file_handler, json_data)
**add_new_item**: The function of `add_new_item` is to add new projects to the JSON file and generate corresponding documentation.

**Parameters**:
- `file_handler` (FileHandler): The file handler object for reading and writing files.
- `json_data` (dict): The JSON data storing the project structure information.

**Code Description**:
The `add_new_item` function begins by initializing an empty dictionary `file_dict` to store the objects in the file. It then iterates through the functions and classes in the file using the `get_functions_and_classes` method of the `file_handler` object. For each object, it retrieves the code information using the `get_obj_code_info` method of the `file_handler` object. It then calls the `generate_doc` method of the `chat_engine` object to generate documentation for the code information. The generated markdown content is added to the code information dictionary. Finally, the code information dictionary is added to the `file_dict` dictionary using the object name as the key.

Next, the `file_dict` dictionary is added to the `json_data` dictionary using the file path as the key. The updated `json_data` dictionary is then written back to the JSON file specified by the `project_manager` object.

After updating the JSON file, the function converts the updated file structure in the JSON data to markdown format using the `convert_to_markdown_file` method of the `file_handler` object. The generated markdown content is then written to a .md file in the specified directory.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the necessary file handler and JSON data are provided as input parameters.
- The function relies on the `chat_engine` object to generate accurate and informative documentation for the code objects.
- The JSON file should be properly formatted and accessible for reading and writing.
- It is recommended to review the generated documentation and markdown files to ensure their accuracy and completeness.


***
### FunctionDef process_file_changes(self, repo_path, file_path, is_new_file)
**process_file_changes**: The purpose of the `process_file_changes` function is to handle the changes in a file within the repository. It is called in a loop for each detected changed file. The function processes the changed file based on its absolute file path, including both new files and existing files.

**Parameters**:
- `repo_path` (str): The path to the repository.
- `file_path` (str): The relative path to the file.
- `is_new_file` (bool): Indicates whether the file is new or not.

**Code Description**:
The `process_file_changes` function starts by creating a `FileHandler` object to handle the file operations for the changed file. It then reads the content of the file using the `read_file` method of the `FileHandler` object. 

Next, the function uses the `change_detector` object to parse the differences in the file content. It calls the `get_file_diff` method of the `change_detector` object to retrieve the changes made to the file. The differences are then parsed using the `parse_diffs` method of the `change_detector` object to extract the added and removed line information.

The function further identifies the changes in the structure of the file using the `identify_changes_in_structure` method of the `change_detector` object. It takes the parsed differences and the functions and classes in the source code obtained from the `FileHandler` object. The identified changes are stored in the `changes_in_pyfile` dictionary.

The function then checks if the file path exists in the `project_hierarchy.json` file. If it does, it updates the content of the file in the `json_data` dictionary with the changes using the `update_existing_item` method. The updated `json_data` is then written back to the `project_hierarchy.json` file.

If the file path does not exist in the `project_hierarchy.json` file, it means the file is new. The function adds a new item to the `json_data` dictionary using the `add_new_item` method. The `add_new_item` method generates documentation for the new file and updates the `json_data` accordingly.

After updating the `json_data` and writing it back to the `project_hierarchy.json` file, the function converts the updated file structure in the `json_data` to markdown format using the `convert_to_markdown_file` method of the `FileHandler` object. The generated markdown content is then written to a `.md` file.

Finally, the function adds the unstaged files that meet specific conditions to the staging area using the `add_unstaged_files` method of the `change_detector` object.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the `repo_path` and `file_path` parameters are correctly provided.
- The function relies on the `FileHandler`, `change_detector`, and `project_manager` objects to perform the necessary file operations, difference detection, and documentation generation.
- The `project_hierarchy.json` file should be properly formatted and accessible for reading and writing.
- It is recommended to review the generated documentation and markdown files to ensure their accuracy and completeness.
***
### FunctionDef update_existing_item(self, file_dict, file_handler, changes_in_pyfile)
**update_existing_item**: The function of update_existing_item is to update existing projects by modifying the file structure information dictionary based on the changes in the .py file.

**Parameters**:
- `file_dict` (dict): A dictionary containing the old object information.
- `file_handler` (FileHandler): The file handler object.
- `changes_in_pyfile` (dict): A dictionary containing information about the objects that have changed in the file.

**Code Description**:
The `update_existing_item` function takes three parameters: `file_dict`, `file_handler`, and `changes_in_pyfile`. 

First, the function calls the `get_new_objects` method to retrieve the added and deleted objects in the file. The added objects are stored in the `new_obj` variable, and the deleted objects are stored in the `del_obj` variable.

Next, the function iterates over the deleted objects and removes them from the `file_dict` if they exist. It also logs a message indicating that the object has been deleted.

Then, the function generates the current file structure information by calling the `generate_file_structure` method of the `file_handler` object. It retrieves the current objects from the generated file structure and stores them in the `current_info_dict` dictionary.

After that, the function updates the global file structure information in the `file_dict` based on the current file structure information. For each current object, if it exists in the `file_dict`, the function updates its information such as type, code start line, code end line, parent, and name column. If the current object does not exist in the `file_dict`, it adds the new object to the `file_dict`.

Next, the function iterates over the added objects in the `changes_in_pyfile` dictionary. For each added object, it searches for the corresponding current object in the `current_objects` and retrieves its referencers by calling the `find_all_referencer` method of the `project_manager` object. It then adds the object name and its referencer list to the `referencer_list`.

The function uses a `ThreadPoolExecutor` to concurrently update the objects in the `changes_in_pyfile`. For each changed object, it retrieves the corresponding referencer list from the `referencer_list` and submits a task to the executor to update the object by calling the `update_object` method. It also prints a message indicating the progress of the documentation generation.

Finally, the function returns the updated `file_dict`.

**Note**:
- The `update_existing_item` function is an important part of the project's documentation generation process. It updates the file structure information dictionary based on the changes in the .py file and generates documentation content for the added objects.
- Developers should ensure that the necessary parameters are provided correctly when calling the `update_existing_item` function.
- The function relies on the `get_new_objects`, `generate_file_structure`, and `update_object` methods to perform the necessary operations.
- The returned file structure information dictionary can be used for further analysis and understanding of the code structure.

**Output Example**:
{
    "function_name": {
        "type": "function",
        "code_start_line": 10,
        "code_end_line": 20,

- `obj_referencer_list` (list): The list of object referencers.

**Code Description**:
The `update_object` function is responsible for generating documentation content and updating the corresponding field information of the object. It takes in several parameters including `file_dict`, `file_handler`, `obj_name`, and `obj_referencer_list`.

The function first checks if the `obj_name` exists in the `file_dict`. If it does, it retrieves the object from the dictionary and assigns it to the variable `obj`. 

Next, the function calls the `generate_doc` function of the `ChatEngine` object, passing in the `obj`, `file_handler`, and `obj_referencer_list` as arguments. This function generates the documentation content for the `obj` based on its code and project structure.

The generated documentation content is then assigned to the `md_content` field of the `obj` dictionary.

**Note**:
- The `update_object` function is an important part of the documentation generation process. It retrieves the object from the `file_dict` and generates the documentation content using the `generate_doc` function.
- Developers should ensure that the necessary parameters are provided correctly when calling the `update_object` function.
- The generated documentation content is stored in the `md_content` field of the object dictionary, which can be accessed for further processing or display.

Please note that the content of the generated documentation may vary depending on the specific code and project structure. It is recommended to review and validate the generated documentation to ensure its accuracy and completeness.

### FunctionDef get_new_objects(self, file_handler)
**get_new_objects**: The function of get_new_objects is to retrieve the added and deleted objects by comparing the current version and the previous version of a .py file.

**parameters**:
- file_handler (FileHandler): The file handler object.

**Code Description**:
The get_new_objects function takes a file_handler object as input and performs the following steps:
1. It calls the get_modified_file_versions function of the file_handler object to retrieve the current and previous versions of the .py file.
2. It calls the get_functions_and_classes function of the file_handler object to parse the current and previous versions of the .py file and retrieve all functions and classes along with their parameters and hierarchical relationships.
3. It creates sets of the function and class names from the current and previous versions.
4. It calculates the added objects by finding the set difference between the current and previous objects.
5. It calculates the deleted objects by finding the set difference between the previous and current objects.
6. It converts the added and deleted objects from sets to lists.
7. It returns a tuple containing the added and deleted objects.

The get_new_objects function is called within the update_existing_item method of the Runner class. It is used to compare the current and previous versions of a .py file and extract the added and deleted objects. The added objects are then used to find their referencers and update the file structure information dictionary.

**Note**:
- The get_new_objects function relies on the get_modified_file_versions and get_functions_and_classes functions of the file_handler object to retrieve the current and previous versions of the .py file and parse the code content.
- The function assumes that the file_handler object is correctly initialized and the necessary file paths are set.
- The function handles cases where the previous version of the .py file is not available, such as when the file is newly added and not present in previous commits.

**Output Example**:
new_obj: ['add_context_stack', '__init__']
del_obj: []
