## FunctionDef make_fake_files
**make_fake_files**: The function of make_fake_files is to detect staging area information based on the git status and perform specific actions on the files in the target repository accordingly.

**parameters**:
- This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The `make_fake_files` function is responsible for detecting the staging area information based on the git status and performing specific actions on the files in the target repository. The function follows a set of rules to handle different scenarios for new, modified, and deleted files.

1. New files without being added are ignored.
2. Modified files without being added are renamed as fake files, and the content of the original file is replaced with the content of the file in the git status.
3. Deleted files without being added are renamed as fake files, and a new file with the original file name is created with the content from the git status.

The function starts by calling the `delete_fake_files` function to remove any existing fake files. Then, it initializes a `git.Repo` object using the target repository specified in the settings.

Next, the function retrieves the unstaged changes and untracked files from the git status. The unstaged changes represent files that have been modified but not yet added to the staging area, while the untracked files are files that exist in the file system but are not tracked by git.

The function iterates over the untracked files and ignores any files with the ".py" extension. These files are added to the `jump_files` list, which will be excluded from parsing and documentation generation.

For each unstaged change of type 'A' (added), the function checks if the file ends with a specific substring (`latest_verison_substring`). If it does, an error message is logged, suggesting the use of the `delete_fake_files` function to remove the fake file. The file is then added to the `jump_files` list.

Next, the function iterates over the unstaged changes of types 'M' (modified) and 'D' (deleted). For each modified or deleted file, the function checks if it ends with the `latest_verison_substring`. If it does, an error message is logged, suggesting the use of the `delete_fake_files` function to remove the fake file.

If the file is a Python file (ends with ".py"), the function performs the following actions:
1. Reads the raw file content from the git status.
2. Renames the original file to a fake file by replacing the `latest_verison_substring` with ".py" to get the original file name.
3. If the original file exists, it is renamed to the latest version file by appending the `latest_verison_substring` to the file name.
4. If the original file does not exist, a new file with the original file name is created.
5. The content of the original file is replaced with the raw file content from the git status.
6. The file path reflections dictionary is updated to reflect the mapping between the original file path and the latest version file path.

Finally, the function returns the file path reflections dictionary and the jump files list.

**Note**:
- The `make_fake_files` function is an important step in the documentation generation process as it handles the detection and manipulation of files in the target repository.
- It is recommended to use the `delete_fake_files` function after the documentation task is completed to ensure the workspace is clean and free of unnecessary files.

**Output Example**:
```
{
    "path/to/original_file.py": "path/to/latest_version_file.py",
    ...
}
```
## FunctionDef delete_fake_files
**delete_fake_files**: The function of delete_fake_files is to remove all fake files after the task execution is completed.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `delete_fake_files` function is responsible for deleting fake files generated during the documentation process. Within the function, there is a nested function `gci(filepath)` that recursively traverses all files in the specified `filepath`, including subdirectories. 

For each file encountered, the function checks if it is a directory or if it ends with a specific substring (`latest_verison_substring`). If the file is a directory, the function recursively calls itself on that directory. If the file ends with the specified substring, it performs the following actions:
1. Replaces the substring with ".py" to get the original file name.
2. Removes the original file.
3. If the file size is 0, it prints the target repository path and deletes the temporary file.
4. If the file size is not 0, it prints a message indicating the recovery of the latest version by renaming the file.

After defining the `gci` function, the `delete_fake_files` function calls `gci` on the target repository specified in the settings.

**Note**: 
- This function is crucial for cleaning up temporary files generated during the documentation process.
- It is recommended to use this function after the documentation task is completed to ensure the workspace is clean and free of unnecessary files.
### FunctionDef gci(filepath)
**gci**: The function of gci is to recursively traverse a specified filepath, delete temporary files, and recover the latest version of files.

**parameters**:
- filepath: The path of the directory to be traversed.

**Code Description**:
The gci function starts by listing all files in the specified filepath. It then iterates through each file in the directory. If a file is a subdirectory, the function recursively calls itself on that subdirectory. If the file ends with a specific substring (latest_version_substring), it performs the following actions:
1. Replaces the latest_version_substring with ".py" in the file path.
2. Deletes the original file with the updated path.
3. If the file size is 0, it prints the target repository path and deletes the temporary file.
4. If the file size is not 0, it prints a message indicating the recovery of the latest version by renaming the file.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the latest_version_substring variable is defined and accessible within the scope of the function for proper execution.
- Be cautious when using this function as it involves file deletion and renaming operations, which can result in data loss if not handled correctly.
