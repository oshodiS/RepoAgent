## FunctionDef make_fake_files
**make_fake_files**: The function of make_fake_files is to generate fake files based on the git status of the target repository. It performs different actions based on the status of each file, such as creating temporary files for deleted files, renaming files for modified files, and ignoring newly added files. The function also checks for any fake files in the git status and raises an error if detected. The generated fake files are used for the documentation generation process.

**parameters**:
- This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**:
The make_fake_files function starts by calling the delete_fake_files function to remove any existing fake files. It then initializes a git repository object using the target repository path specified in the project settings. The function retrieves the unstaged changes and untracked files from the git status.

Next, the function iterates over the untracked files and skips any files with the ".py" extension. It prints a message indicating the skipped file.

The function then iterates over the unstaged changes and checks for files that have been added but not staged. It appends these files to the jump_files list. If a file ends with the latest_version_substring (a specific substring defined elsewhere in the code), it raises an error to suggest using the delete_fake_files function to remove the fake file.

After that, the function creates a dictionary called file_path_reflections to store the mapping between the original file path and the corresponding fake file path. It iterates over the unstaged changes again, this time filtering for modified and deleted files. If a file ends with the latest_version_substring, it raises an error to suggest using the delete_fake_files function. For each modified file, the function reads the raw file content, renames the original file to a fake file, and creates a new file with the original file name and the content from the git status. If the file does not exist in the target repository, it creates a temporary file with an empty content. The function updates the file_path_reflections dictionary with the mapping between the original file path and the fake file path.

Finally, the function returns the file_path_reflections dictionary and the jump_files list.

**Note**: It is important to use the delete_fake_files function before generating or updating documents to ensure the removal of any existing fake files and maintain the integrity of the documentation process.

**Output Example**:
{
    "original_file.py": "fake_file.py",
    "modified_file.py": "fake_file.py"
},
["jump_file.py"]
## FunctionDef delete_fake_files
**delete_fake_files**: The function of delete_fake_files is to remove all fake files after the task execution is completed.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The delete_fake_files function contains a nested function gci(filepath) that recursively traverses all files in the specified filepath, including subdirectories. Within the gci function, the code checks if a file ends with a specific substring (latest_version_substring), then it replaces the substring with ".py" in the file name. It proceeds to remove the original file, and if the file size is 0, it prints a message indicating the deletion of a temporary file and removes it. Otherwise, it prints a message indicating the recovery of the latest version, renames the file, and continues to the next file. Finally, the delete_fake_files function calls the gci function with the target repository path (setting.project.target_repo) to start the process of deleting fake files.

In the project, the delete_fake_files function is called by the clean function in main.py to clean up fake files generated during the documentation process. After calling delete_fake_files, the clean function logs a success message confirming the cleanup of fake files. Additionally, the run function in runner.py also calls delete_fake_files as part of the document update process to ensure the removal of fake files before proceeding with document generation.

**Note**: It is essential to use delete_fake_files to remove fake files before generating or updating documents to maintain the integrity of the documentation process.
### FunctionDef gci(filepath)
**gci**: The function of gci is to recursively traverse a specified filepath, delete temporary files, and recover the latest version of files.

**parameters**:
- filepath: The path to the directory to be traversed.

**Code Description**:
The gci function starts by listing all files in the specified filepath. It then iterates through each file. If a file is a directory, the function recursively calls itself on that directory. If a file ends with a specific substring (latest_version_substring), it performs the following actions:
1. Replaces the latest_version_substring with ".py" to get the original file name.
2. Removes the original file.
3. If the file size is 0, it prints a message indicating the deletion of a temporary file and removes the file.
4. If the file size is not 0, it prints a message indicating the recovery of the latest version by renaming the file.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the latest_version_substring variable is defined and correctly set before calling the gci function.
- Exercise caution when using this function as it involves file deletion and renaming operations.
