## FunctionDef make_fake_files
**make_fake_files**: The function of make_fake_files is to detect staging area information based on git status and perform specific actions on different types of files. It returns a dictionary containing the mapping between the original file paths and the corresponding fake file paths, as well as a list of jump files that should be skipped during parsing and documentation generation.

**parameters**:
- No parameters are required for this function.

**Code Description**:
The `make_fake_files` function is responsible for detecting staging area information based on git status and performing specific actions on different types of files. The function first calls the `delete_fake_files` function to remove any existing fake files.

Next, it initializes a `git.Repo` object using the target repository path obtained from the project settings. It then retrieves the unstaged changes and untracked files from the repository.

The function iterates over the untracked files and skips any files with the ".py" extension, printing a message indicating the skipped file. It also appends these files to the `jump_files` list.

For the newly added files (change type 'A') in the unstaged changes, the function checks if the file path ends with a specific substring (`latest_verison_substring`). If it does, an error message is logged, suggesting the use of the `delete_fake_files` function to remove the fake file. The file path is then added to the `jump_files` list.

Next, the function iterates over the modified and deleted files (change types 'M' and 'D') in the unstaged changes. For each file, it checks if the file path ends with the `latest_verison_substring`. If it does, an error message is logged, suggesting the use of the `delete_fake_files` function to remove the fake file.

For modified files, the function retrieves the raw file content from the `diff_file` object and renames the original file to a fake file by replacing the file extension with the `latest_verison_substring`. It then writes the raw file content to the original file.

For deleted files, the function creates a new fake file with the same name as the original file, using the `latest_verison_substring` as the file extension. If the original file exists, it is renamed to the fake file. Otherwise, an empty file is created with the fake file name.

The function keeps track of the mapping between the original file paths and the corresponding fake file paths in the `file_path_reflections` dictionary.

Finally, the function returns the `file_path_reflections` dictionary and the `jump_files` list.

**Note**: It is important to call the `delete_fake_files` function before using the `make_fake_files` function to ensure the integrity of the document generation process.

**Output Example**:
```
{
    "original_file_path1.py": "fake_file_path1.py",
    "original_file_path2.py": "fake_file_path2.py",
    ...
},
[
    "jump_file1.py",
    "jump_file2.py",
    ...
]
```
## FunctionDef delete_fake_files
**delete_fake_files**: The function of delete_fake_files is to remove all fake files after the task execution is completed.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: The `delete_fake_files` function first defines an inner function `gci` to traverse all files in a specified filepath, including subdirectories. Within the `gci` function, it identifies fake files based on a specific substring and performs the following actions:
- Replaces the fake file extension with ".py".
- Deletes the original fake file if its size is 0, otherwise, it recovers the latest version by renaming the fake file.
- Prints messages indicating the actions taken on the fake files.

After defining the `gci` function, the `delete_fake_files` function calls `gci` with the target repository path obtained from the project settings.

In the project, the `delete_fake_files` function is called in the following contexts:
1. In the `make_fake_files` function located in `meta_info_utils.py`, it is called to clean fake files before detecting staging area information based on git status.
2. In the `diff` function in `main.py`, it is called to delete fake files before checking for changes and printing which documents will be updated or generated.
3. In the `run` method of the `Runner` class in `runner.py`, it is called after the document update process to delete fake files.

**Note**: It is essential to call `delete_fake_files` function when dealing with fake files to ensure the integrity of the document generation process.
### FunctionDef gci(filepath)
**gci**: The function of gci is to recursively traverse a specified filepath, delete specific files, and perform file operations based on certain conditions.

**parameters**:
- filepath: The path of the directory to be traversed.

**Code Description**:
The gci function starts by listing all files in the specified filepath. It then iterates through each file in the directory. If the current file is a directory, the function recursively calls itself on that directory. If the file ends with a specific substring (latest_version_substring), it performs the following operations:
1. Replaces the latest_version_substring with ".py" in the file path.
2. Deletes the original file with the modified path.
3. If the file size is 0, it prints the target repository path and deletes the temporary file.
4. If the file size is not 0, it prints a message indicating the recovery of the latest version by renaming the file.

**Note**:
- Ensure that the latest_version_substring variable is defined and accessible within the function for proper execution.
- Exercise caution when using this function as it involves file deletion and renaming operations.
