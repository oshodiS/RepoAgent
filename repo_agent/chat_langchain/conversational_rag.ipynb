It then determines the source directory by joining the repo_path with the markdown_docs_folder.\\n\\nIf the destination directory does not exist, it creates one and prints a message indicating the creation. It then iterates through the items in the source directory. For each item, it checks if it is a folder or a file. If it is a folder, it uses shutil.copytree to copy the entire folder to the destination directory. If it is a file, it uses shutil.copy2 to copy the file to the destination directory. For each copy operation, a message is printed indicating the action taken.\\n\\nAfter copying all the files, the function checks if a README.md file exists in the destination directory. If not, it creates one and writes the book_name as the content of the README.md file.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the correct command-line arguments are provided when calling this function to avoid errors.\\n- The function assumes the existence of the necessary directories and files as specified in the arguments.\\n\\nFunctionDef create_book_readme_if_not_exist(dire)\\n\\ncreate_book_readme_if_not_exist: The function of create_book_readme_if_not_exist is to create a README.md file in the specified directory if it does not already exist.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- dire: The directory path where the README.md file should be created.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe function first constructs the path to the README.md file by joining the provided directory path with the filename 'README.md'. It then checks if a file already exists at that path. If the file does not exist, it creates a new README.md file in the specified directory and writes a header containing the book name.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the 'book_name' variable is defined and accessible within the scope of the function before calling create_book_readme_if_not_exist.\\n- Make sure to handle any potential exceptions related to file operations or directory paths when using this function.\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\reply\\\\RepoAgent\\\\markdown_docs\\\\display\\\\book_tools\\\\generate_summary_from_book.md'}, page_content=\"FunctionDef create_readme_if_not_exist(dire)\\n\\ncreate_readme_if_not_exist: The function of create_readme_if_not_exist is to create a README.md file in a specified directory if it does not already exist.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- dire: The directory path where the README.md file should be created.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe create_readme_if_not_exist function first constructs the path to the README.md file within the specified directory. It then checks if the README.md file already exists in that directory. If the file does not exist, it opens the README.md file in write mode and writes the directory name as a header in markdown format.\\n\\nThis function is called within the output_markdown function, which iterates through files and directories in a given directory. For each directory encountered, it ensures a README.md file is created if it does not exist. This is useful for maintaining a structured documentation system within directories.\\n\\nNote:\\nEnsure that the directory path provided as input exists before calling the create_readme_if_not_exist function to avoid any errors.\\n\\nFunctionDef output_markdown(dire, base_dir, output_file, iter_depth)\\n\\noutput_markdown: The function of output_markdown is to generate a markdown summary of files and directories within a specified directory, including creating markdown links to README.md files and markdown files.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- dire: The directory path to be processed.\\n- base_dir: The base directory path for relative referencing.\\n- output_file: The output file object to write the markdown summary.\\n- iter_depth: The iteration depth for nested directories (default is 0).\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe output_markdown function iterates through the files and directories in the specified directory. It first ensures that a README.md file is created for each directory if it does not already exist by calling the create_readme_if_not_exist function. Then, it processes each file and directory, creating markdown links in the output_file for README.md files and markdown files found. For directories, it recursively calls itself to handle nested directories.\\n\\nThe function also utilizes the is_markdown_file function to check if a file is a Markdown file before including it in the markdown summary. It excludes certain files like 'SUMMARY.md' and 'README.md' based on the iteration depth to maintain the summary's structure.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the directory paths provided exist before calling the output_markdown function.\\n- The function relies on the create_readme_if_not_exist and is_markdown_file functions for specific tasks within the markdown generation process.\\n\\nFunctionDef markdown_file_in_dir(dire)\\n\\nmarkdown_file_in_dir: The function of markdown_file_in_dir is to check if there are any Markdown (.md) or Markdown (.markdown) files in a specified directory.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- dire: A string representing the directory path to be checked for Markdown files.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe function markdown_file_in_dir takes a directory path as input and uses the os.walk method to traverse through all the files in the directory and its subdirectories. It then iterates over each file and checks if the file name ends with '.md' or '.markdown' using a regular expression. If such a file is found, the function returns True. If no Markdown files are found in the directory, the function returns False.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Make sure to provide a valid directory path as input to the function.\\n- The function only checks for files with '.md' or '.markdown' extensions, not the content of the files.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nTrue\\n\\nFunctionDef is_markdown_file(filename)\\n\\nis_markdown_file: The function of is_markdown_file is to check if a given filename corresponds to a Markdown file based on its extension.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- filename: A string representing the name of the file to be checked.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe is_markdown_file function uses a regular expression to search for the file extension '.md' or '.markdown' at the end of the filename. If a match is found, the function returns the filename without the extension if it matches either '.md' or '.markdown'.\\n\\nIn the calling object output_markdown, the is_markdown_file function is used to determine if a file is a Markdown file before processing it further. If the file is a Markdown file and meets certain conditions, a markdown link to the file is created in the output.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the filename parameter is a valid string representing a file name.\\n- The function only checks for the presence of '.md' or '.markdown' at the end of the filename to determine if it is a Markdown file.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf the input filename is 'example.md', the function will return 'example'.\\n\\nFunctionDef main\\n\\nmain: The function of main is to create a markdown summary file for a specified book directory, including markdown links to relevant files and directories.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- book_name: The name of the book directory.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe main function first creates a directory path for the book folder within the 'books' directory. It then checks if the directory exists and creates it if not. Subsequently, it creates a SUMMARY.md file within the book directory and writes a header for the summary. The function then calls the output_markdown function to generate the markdown summary based on the contents of the book directory. Finally, it prints a message indicating the completion of the GitBook auto summary process.\\n\\nIn this process, the main function relies on the output_markdown function to handle the markdown generation logic, ensuring that the summary includes relevant markdown links to README.md files and markdown files within the book directory.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the book directory path provided as an argument exists before executing the main function.\\n- The main function is essential for initiating the markdown summary generation process for a book directory.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n\\nSummary\\n\\nfile1.md\\n\\nfile2.md\\n\\ndirectory1\\n\\nfile3.md\\n\\ndirectory2\\nfile4.md\\nGitBook auto summary finished:)\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\reply\\\\RepoAgent\\\\markdown_docs\\\\repo_agent\\\\change_detector.md'}, page_content='FunctionDef observe_updating\\n\\nobserve_updating: The function of observe_updating is to print \"AGAIN\" and \"The documentation added it\".\\n\\nparameters: This Function does not take any parameters.\\n\\nCode Description: The observe_updating function is a simple function that prints \"AGAIN\" and \"The documentation added it\" to the console when called. It does not require any input parameters and serves as a basic demonstration of printing messages.\\n\\nNote: This function is straightforward and does not have any specific use case other than demonstrating the printing functionality.\\n\\nClassDef ChangeDetector\\n\\nChangeDetector: The ChangeDetector class is responsible for handling file differences and change detection. It utilizes the FileHandler class to access the file system. The core functionality of the ChangeDetector class is to identify changes in files since the last commit.\\n\\nAttributes:\\n- repo_path (str): The path to the repository.\\n- repo (git.Repo): The Git repository object.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe ChangeDetector class provides several methods to track and analyze changes in files within a Git repository.\\n\\nThe __init__ method initializes a ChangeDetector object by setting the repo_path attribute and creating a git.Repo object for the specified repository path.\\n\\nThe get_staged_pys method retrieves the added Python files in the repository that have been staged. It uses the GitPython library to compare the staging area (index) with the original HEAD commit. The method returns a dictionary of changed Python files, where the keys are the file paths and the values are booleans indicating whether the file is newly created or not.\\n\\nThe get_file_diff method retrieves the changes made to a specific file. For new files, it adds them to the staging area and then gets the diff from the staging area. For non-new files, it gets the diff from HEAD. The method returns a list of changes made to the file.\\n\\nThe parse_diffs method parses the difference content obtained from the get_file_diff method. It extracts the added and deleted object information, which can be a class or a function. The method returns a dictionary containing the added and deleted line information.\\n\\nThe identify_changes_in_structure method identifies the structure (function or class) where changes have occurred. It traverses all changed lines and checks whether each line falls within the start and end line numbers of a structure. If a line is within a structure, the structure is considered to have changed, and its name and the name of the parent structure are added to the corresponding set in the result dictionary. The method returns a dictionary containing the structures where changes have occurred.\\n\\nThe get_to_be_staged_files method retrieves all unstaged files in the repository that meet certain conditions. It checks for files with extensions changed to .md that correspond to already staged files, as well as files with paths matching the \\'project_hierarchy\\' field in the CONFIG. The method returns a list of the paths of these files.\\n\\nThe add_unstaged_files method adds unstaged files that meet the conditions to the staging area. It calls the get_to_be_staged_files method to retrieve the files and uses the git add command to add them to the staging area.\\n\\nNote: The identify_changes_in_structure method may have some issues and requires further testing and improvement. The get_to_be_staged_files method may also have some issues and may benefit from better implementation.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\n{\\n    \\'added\\': [\\n        (86, \\'    \\'),\\n        (87, \\'    def to_json_new(self, comments = True):\\'),\\n        (88, \\'        data = {\\'),\\n        (89, \\'            \"name\": self.node_name,\\'),\\n        ...\\n    ],\\n    \\'removed\\': []\\n}\\n\\nFunctionDef init(self, repo_path)\\n\\ninit: The function of init is to initialize a ChangeDetector object.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- repo_path: A string representing the path to the repository.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe init function initializes a ChangeDetector object by assigning the provided repo_path to the self.repo_path attribute. Additionally, it creates a git Repo object using the repo_path.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Make sure to provide a valid repo_path string when initializing the ChangeDetector object to ensure proper functionality.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_staged_pys(self)\\n\\nget_staged_pys: The function of get_staged_pys is to retrieve added Python files in the repository that have been staged.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- No external parameters are required for this function.\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe get_staged_pys function operates by first obtaining the repository object. It then detects staged changes by utilizing the GitPython library to compare the staging area with the original HEAD commit. By iterating through the detected differences, the function identifies added or modified Python files that end with the \".py\" extension. The function constructs a dictionary where the keys represent the file paths, and the values indicate whether the file is newly created or not based on the change type.\\n\\nIn the project, this function is called within the TestChangeDetector class to test the functionality of identifying staged Python files. The test scenario involves creating a new Python file, staging it, initializing a ChangeDetector object with the repository path, and then verifying that the newly created file is present in the list of staged files.\\n\\nNote: \\nIt is crucial to note that the logic of the GitPython library differs from the standard Git behavior, particularly in handling new files in the staging area. The use of the R=True parameter is essential to ensure correct comparison and identification of newly added files.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\n{\\n    \\'new_test_file.py\\': True\\n}\\n\\nFunctionDef get_file_diff(self, file_path, is_new_file)\\n\\nget_file_diff: The function of get_file_diff is to retrieve the changes made to a specific file. For new files, it uses git diff --staged to get the differences.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- file_path (str): The relative path of the file.\\n- is_new_file (bool): Indicates whether the file is a new file.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_file_diff function retrieves the changes made to a file based on the provided file path and whether the file is new or not. If the file is new, it adds the file to the staging area using Git commands and then retrieves the differences using git diff --staged. For existing files, it gets the differences from the HEAD. The function returns a list of changes made to the file.\\n\\nThis function is called within the process_file_changes method in the Runner class. In the process_file_changes method, the get_file_diff function is used to obtain the changes in the file specified by the file_path parameter. The changes are then further processed to identify the changes in the file structure and update the project hierarchy accordingly.\\n\\nNote:\\nEnsure that the repo attribute is properly initialized before calling this function to avoid errors.\\nMake sure to handle exceptions related to subprocess calls appropriately.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n[\\'- line 1: old content\\', \\'+ line 1: new content\\']\\n\\nFunctionDef parse_diffs(self, diffs)\\n\\nparse_diffs: The function of parse_diffs is to parse the difference content from a list of differences, extract added and deleted object information, and return a dictionary containing added and deleted line information.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- diffs (list): A list containing difference content obtained from the get_file_diff() function inside the class.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe parse_diffs function processes the differences in the provided list, identifies added and removed lines, and constructs a dictionary with information about the changes. It iterates through the differences, extracts line numbers, and categorizes lines as added or removed based on specific prefixes. The function then returns a dictionary containing the added and removed line information.\\n\\nWhen called within the project, the parse_diffs function is utilized in the process_file_changes method of the Runner class. In this context, parse_diffs is used to identify changes in structure within Python files, update corresponding JSON files, convert content to Markdown, and manage version control operations.\\n\\nNote: \\n- The parse_diffs function is dependent on the get_file_diff() method to obtain the difference content.\\n- The function distinguishes between added and removed lines based on specific prefixes in the differences.\\n- It is crucial to ensure the correct input format (list of differences) when calling the parse_diffs function.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n{\\'added\\': [(86, \\'    \\'), (87, \\'    def to_json_new(self, comments = True):\\'), (88, \\'        data = {\\'), (89, \\'            \"name\": self.node_name,\\')...(95, \\'\\')], \\'removed\\': []}\\n\\nFunctionDef identify_changes_in_structure(self, changed_lines, structures)\\n\\nidentify_changes_in_structure: The function of identify_changes_in_structure is to identify the structures (functions or classes) where changes have occurred based on the provided changed lines and structures list.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- changed_lines (dict): A dictionary containing the line numbers where changes have occurred, with keys \\'added\\' and \\'removed\\'.\\n- structures (list): A list of function or class structures containing structure type, name, start line number, end line number, and parent structure name.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe function iterates through the changed lines and structures to determine if a line falls within a structure\\'s start and end lines. If a line is within a structure, the function adds the structure\\'s name and parent structure\\'s name to the result dictionary based on whether the line was added or removed.\\n\\nIn the calling object process_file_changes in runner.py, this function is used to identify changes in the structure of a file by parsing the differences in the file, extracting functions and classes, and updating the project hierarchy information accordingly. The identified changes are logged, and if the file is found in the project hierarchy, its information is updated and written back to the JSON file. Additionally, a Markdown file is created based on the updated information. If the file is not found, a new item is added to the project hierarchy.\\n\\nNote: \\n- Ensure that the changed_lines and structures parameters are correctly formatted as described in the function documentation.\\n- The function assumes that the structures list is obtained from get_functions_and_classes method.\\n- The output dictionary contains sets of structure names and parent structure names for added and removed changes.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\n{\\'added\\': {(\\'PipelineAutoMatNode\\', None), (\\'to_json_new\\', \\'PipelineAutoMatNode\\')}, \\'removed\\': set()}\\n\\nFunctionDef get_to_be_staged_files(self)\\n\\nget_to_be_staged_files: The function of get_to_be_staged_files is to retrieve all unstaged files in the repository that meet specific conditions and return a list of their paths.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- None\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_to_be_staged_files function first retrieves the already staged files in the repository. It then identifies unstaged files based on two conditions: files whose extension changes to .md correspond to staged files, and files whose path matches the \\'project_hierarchy\\' field in the configuration. The function processes untracked files and unstaged files separately, checking if they meet the specified conditions for inclusion in the list of files to be staged. Finally, it returns a list of relative file paths that are either modified but not staged or untracked and meet the defined conditions.\\n\\nIn the project, this function is called by the add_unstaged_files method in the ChangeDetector class. The add_unstaged_files method utilizes the get_to_be_staged_files function to identify unstaged files meeting the conditions and adds them to the staging area using Git commands.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The function handles both untracked and unstaged files based on specific conditions to determine which files should be staged.\\n- It interacts with the Git repository to identify staged and unstaged files accurately.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n[\\'path/to/unstaged_file1.md\\', \\'path/to/unstaged_file2.py\\', ...]\\n\\nFunctionDef add_unstaged_files(self)\\n\\nadd_unstaged_files: The function of add_unstaged_files is to add unstaged files that meet specific conditions to the staging area in a Git repository.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- None\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe add_unstaged_files function is a method of the ChangeDetector class in the repo_agent/change_detector.py file. It is responsible for adding unstaged files to the staging area in a Git repository.\\n\\nThe function first calls the get_to_be_staged_files method to retrieve a list of unstaged files that meet certain conditions. It then iterates over each file path in the list and constructs a Git command to add the file to the staging area. The subprocess.run function is used to execute the Git command.\\n\\nFinally, the function returns the list of unstaged files that were added to the staging area.\\n\\nThis function is called within the run method of the Runner class in the repo_agent/runner.py file. The run method is responsible for running the document update process. After generating and updating the documents, the add_unstaged_files method is called to add the newly generated Markdown files to the staging area.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The function relies on the get_to_be_staged_files method to retrieve the list of unstaged files that meet the conditions.\\n- It uses the subprocess.run function to execute Git commands for adding files to the staging area.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n[\\'path/to/unstaged_file1.md\\', \\'path/to/unstaged_file2.py\\', ...]'), Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\reply\\\\RepoAgent\\\\markdown_docs\\\\repo_agent\\\\chat_engine.md'}, page_content='FunctionDef get_import_statements\\n\\nget_import_statements: The function of get_import_statements is to extract import statements from the source code of the current module.\\n\\nparameters: This Function does not take any parameters.\\n\\nCode Description: The get_import_statements function utilizes the inspect module to retrieve the source code lines of the current module. It then filters out lines that start with \"import\" or \"from\" and stores them in a list. Finally, it returns the list of import statements found in the source code.\\n\\nNote: This function is useful for analyzing the dependencies of a module by extracting the import statements used within the code.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\n[\\'import sys\\', \\'import inspect\\']\\n\\nClassDef ResponseMessage\\n\\nResponseMessage: The function of ResponseMessage is to store a string content.\\n\\nattributes: \\n- content: a string that represents the content of the response message.\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe ResponseMessage class defines an object that holds a string content representing a response message. This class has one attribute:\\n- content: This attribute stores the actual text content of the response message.\\n\\nThe class is utilized within the project in the attempt_generate_response method of the ChatEngine class. In this method, instances of ResponseMessage are created to handle different scenarios during the generation of a response. If an unknown error occurs while attempting to generate a response, a ResponseMessage object is instantiated with a specific error message.\\n\\nThe ResponseMessage class serves as a simple container for response messages within the project, allowing for easy management and retrieval of response content.\\n\\nNote: \\nDevelopers can utilize the ResponseMessage class to encapsulate and manage response messages efficiently within the project.\\n\\nClassDef ChatEngine\\n\\nChatEngine: The function of ChatEngine is to generate the documentation of functions or classes.\\n\\nattributes:\\n- project_manager: The project manager object that handles the project hierarchy.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe ChatEngine class is responsible for generating documentation for functions or classes. It contains several methods that facilitate the generation of documentation.\\n\\nThe num_tokens_from_string method takes a text string as input and returns the number of tokens in the string. It uses the tiktoken library to encode the string and then calculates the length of the encoded tokens.\\n\\nThe reduce_input_length method is used to shorten the length of input prompts by modifying the sys_prompt contents. It takes two parameters, shorten_attempt and prompt_data. The method first logs the attempt number to reduce the length of the messages. If it is the first attempt, it removes the project_structure and project_structure_prefix from the prompt_data. If it is the second attempt, it further removes the caller and callee (reference) information from the prompt_data. Finally, it updates the sys_prompt with the modified prompt_data and returns it.\\n\\nThe generate_response method generates a response message using the OpenAI API. It takes four parameters: model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, and max_tokens. It creates a list of messages containing the system prompt and user prompt. It then sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a completion based on the model, messages, temperature, and max tokens. The response message is extracted from the API response and returned.\\n\\nThe attempt_generate_response method attempts to generate a response message using the generate_response method. It takes five parameters: model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, max_tokens, and max_attempts. It tries to generate a response message using the generate_response method. If the response message is None, it retries the request after a delay. If there is a connection error, it logs the error and retries after a delay. If there is an unknown error, it logs the error and retries after a longer delay. After a maximum number of attempts, it raises an exception or returns a default response message.\\n\\nThe generate_doc method generates the documentation for a given doc_item. It takes two parameters: doc_item and file_handler. It extracts the code information from the doc_item and determines if the code is referenced by other objects. It then constructs the initial prompt data with the relevant information. If the total tokens exceed the model\\'s input limit, it tries to find a larger model or shorten the input length. If successful, it sends a request to generate the documentation using the attempt_generate_response method.

This allows the ChatEngine object to interact with the specified project manager during its operation.\\n\\nNote:\\nIt is essential to provide a valid project_manager object when initializing a ChatEngine instance to ensure proper functionality and communication with the project manager.\\n\\nFunctionDef num_tokens_from_string(self, string, encoding_name)\\n\\nnum_tokens_from_string: The function of num_tokens_from_string is to return the number of tokens in a text string.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- string: A string representing the text for which the number of tokens needs to be calculated.\\n- encoding_name: A string specifying the encoding name to be used for tokenization. It defaults to \"cl100k_base\".\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe num_tokens_from_string function takes a text string and an optional encoding name as input. It then retrieves the encoding based on the provided encoding name, tokenizes the input string using the encoding, and finally returns the number of tokens in the tokenized string.\\n\\nNote: \\nEnsure that the input string is in a format compatible with the specified encoding for accurate tokenization results.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\nIf the input string \"Hello, world!\" is passed to the function, and the default encoding \"cl100k_base\" is used for tokenization, the function will return 3 as the output, indicating that there are 3 tokens in the input string after tokenization.\\n\\nFunctionDef reduce_input_length(self, shorten_attempt, prompt_data)\\n\\nreduce_input_length: The function of reduce_input_length is to reduce the length of the input prompts by modifying the sys_prompt contents.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- shorten_attempt: An integer representing the attempt number to shorten the input prompts.\\n- prompt_data: Data structure containing information about the prompt.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe reduce_input_length function is responsible for adjusting the length of input prompts by altering the sys_prompt contents based on the shorten_attempt value. It first logs the attempt number to reduce the length of the messages. Depending on the shorten_attempt value, it modifies the prompt_data structure to adjust the prompt content accordingly. Finally, it updates the sys_prompt by formatting it with the modified prompt_data and returns the updated sys_prompt.\\n\\nThis function is called within the generate_doc method of the ChatEngine class in the chat_engine.py file.

Finally, it extracts the response message from the API response and returns it.\\n\\nIn the calling object attempt_generate_response, the generate_response function is utilized within a loop to attempt generating a response multiple times in case of errors. If the response message is None, the function continues to the next attempt. It handles API connection errors by logging the error, waiting for a specified time, and retrying the request. For other exceptions, it logs the error, waits for a different time, and retries.

Default is 5.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe attempt_generate_response function is a method of the ChatEngine class in the chat_engine.py module. It is responsible for attempting to generate a response by calling the generate_response function multiple times in case of errors.\\n\\nThe function starts by initializing the attempt variable to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues until the attempt variable reaches the max_attempts value.\\n\\nWithin the loop, the function calls the generate_response function with the provided model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, and max_tokens parameters. The response message is stored in the response_message variable.\\n\\nIf the response_message is None, indicating an unsuccessful response generation, the attempt variable is incremented by 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration.\\n\\nIf the response_message is not None, indicating a successful response generation, the function immediately returns the response_message.\\n\\nIf an APIConnectionError exception is raised during the generate_response function call, the error is logged using the logger.error method. The error message includes the specific error and the current attempt number out of the maximum attempts. The function then waits for 7 seconds using the time.sleep method and increments the attempt variable by 1. If the attempt variable reaches the max_attempts value, the exception is raised. Otherwise, the loop continues to the next iteration.\\n\\nIf any other exception is raised during the generate_response function call, the error is logged using the logger.error method. The error message includes the specific error and the current attempt number out of the maximum attempts.

If the attempt variable reaches the max_attempts value, a predefined response message is created using the ResponseMessage class with an error message indicating an unknown error occurred while generating the documentation. The function returns this response message.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Developers should ensure the correct API key, base URL, and timeout settings are provided for successful interaction with the OpenAI API.\\n- Proper exception handling and retry mechanisms should be implemented to improve the robustness of response generation.\\n- The max_attempts parameter can be adjusted to control the number of attempts made to generate a response.\\n- The attempt_generate_response function is called within the project\\'s ChatEngine class to handle response generation attempts.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n\"A generated response message based on the provided prompts and model.\"\\n\\nFunctionDef generate_doc(self, doc_item, file_handler)\\n\\ngenerate_doc: The function of generate_doc is to generate documentation for a given object. It takes a DocItem object, which contains information about the code, and a file_handler object, which provides access to the project\\'s files. The function retrieves the necessary information from the DocItem object, such as the code type, name, content, and whether it has a return value. It also checks if the code is referenced by other objects or if it references other objects.\\n\\nThe function then uses the ProjectManager instance to build the hierarchical structure of the project, including the object\\'s position in the structure. It also retrieves information about the objects that reference the code and the objects that are referenced by the code.\\n\\nNext, the function prepares prompts for the OpenAI chat model by combining the relevant information, such as the code type, name, content, and references. It also handles cases where the total number of tokens in the prompts exceeds the model\\'s limit by either trying a larger model or reducing the input length.\\n\\nOnce the prompts are prepared, the function sends a request to the chat model to generate the documentation. It handles potential errors, such as API connection errors, by logging the errors, waiting for a specified time, and retrying the request. If the maximum number of attempts is reached without a successful response, the function either raises an exception or returns a predefined response message.\\n\\nThe generated documentation is then returned as a response message. If the code is referenced by other objects, the function includes information about the objects that reference it and their corresponding code and documentation. Similarly, if the code references other objects, the function includes information about the objects that are referenced and their corresponding code and documentation. The function also provides a possible appearance of the code\\'s return value as an output example.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the generate_doc function relies on the ChatEngine class and the ResponseMessage class to handle the generation of the documentation and the storage of response messages, respectively.\\n\\nDevelopers can utilize the generate_doc function to automatically generate documentation for code objects in their projects. By providing the necessary information and utilizing the OpenAI chat model, the function can generate detailed and accurate documentation, including information about references and return values.\\n\\nNote: The generate_doc function may encounter limitations in processing code that exceeds the model\\'s token limit. In such cases, the function attempts to use larger models or reduce the input length to generate the documentation. However, if the code itself is too long to process, the function returns a predefined response message indicating the limitation.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_referenced_prompt(doc_item)\\n\\nget_referenced_prompt: The function of get_referenced_prompt is to generate a prompt detailing the objects referenced by a given DocItem, including their code snippets and documentation.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- doc_item: A DocItem object representing the item for which the referenced prompt is generated.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_referenced_prompt function iterates through the referenced objects of the input DocItem and constructs a prompt for each referenced object. It includes the object\\'s full name, documentation content, and raw code snippet. The function appends each prompt to a list and returns the concatenated prompts as a single string.\\n\\nThe function first checks if there are any referenced objects. If there are, it constructs a prompt for each referenced object by extracting the object\\'s full name, documentation content (if available), and raw code snippet. The prompt is formatted with the object\\'s full name, followed by the documentation content (or \\'None\\' if not available), and the raw code snippet enclosed in triple backticks.\\n\\nThe prompts for all referenced objects are collected in a list, and the function joins these prompts with newline characters to create the final prompt string, which is then returned.\\n\\nNote: \\n- This function provides a structured overview of the objects referenced by a given DocItem, aiding in understanding the relationships between different elements in the project.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nAs you can see, the code calls the following objects, their code and docs are as following:\\nobj: repo_agent\\\\doc_meta_info.py/DocItem\\nDocument: \\nAn unknown error occurred while generating this documentation after many tries.\\nRaw code:\\n```\\nclass DocItem:\\n    item_type: DocItemType = DocItemType._class_function\\n    item_status: DocItemStatus = DocItemStatus.doc_has_not_been_generated\\n\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef get_referencer_prompt(doc_item)\\n\\nget_referencer_prompt: The function of get_referencer_prompt is to generate a prompt detailing the objects that reference a given DocItem object, including their code snippets and documentation.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- doc_item: A DocItem object for which the referencing objects prompt is generated.\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe get_referencer_prompt function constructs a prompt that lists the objects referencing a specific DocItem object.

If the referencing object has documentation available, it includes the last entry from the documentation. If the referencing object has code content available, it includes the code snippet.\\n\\nThe function then joins all the individual prompts into a single formatted string and returns it as the final prompt.\\n\\nNote: \\n- The function returns an empty string if there are no referencing objects for the given DocItem.\\n- The prompt generated provides insights into the objects that reference the input DocItem, aiding in understanding the relationships within the codebase.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\nAlso, the code has been called by the following objects, their code and docs are as following:\\nobj: repo_agent\\\\doc_meta_info.py/DocItem\\nDocument: An unknown error occurred while generating this documentation after many tries.\\nRaw code:\\n```python\\nclass DocItem:\\n    item_type: DocItemType = DocItemType._class_function\\n    item_status: DocItemStatus = DocItemStatus.doc_has_not_been_generated\\n\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef get_relationship_description(referencer_content, reference_letter)\\n\\nget_relationship_description: The function of get_relationship_description is to provide a description of the relationship between referencer content and reference letter in a project from a functional perspective.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- referencer_content: Represents the content of the referencer.\\n- reference_letter: Represents the reference letter associated with the referencer.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe function first checks if both referencer_content and reference_letter are present. If they are, it returns a description including the relationship with both callers and callees in the project. If only referencer_content is present, it returns a description including the relationship with callers. If only reference_letter is present, it returns a description including the relationship with callees. If neither referencer_content nor reference_letter is present, it returns an empty string.\\n\\nNote:\\n- This function provides a high-level overview of the relationship between referencer content and reference letter in the project.\\n- The function\\'s output is based on the presence or absence of referencer_content and reference_letter.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n\"And please include the reference relationship with its callers and callees in the project from a functional perspective\"'), Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\reply\\\\RepoAgent\\\\markdown_docs\\\\repo_agent\\\\config_manager.md'}, page_content='FunctionDef get_config_path\\n\\nget_config_path: The function of get_config_path is to retrieve the path to the configuration file used by the application.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- No parameters are passed to this function.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_config_path function first checks the current working directory for a configuration file named config.toml.

If the file is not found in the current directory, the function determines the appropriate configuration path based on the operating system:\\n- For Unix and macOS systems, it uses the home directory.\\n- For Windows systems, it uses the APPDATA directory.\\n- If the operating system detection fails, it defaults to a local directory within the current working directory.\\nThe function ensures that the configuration directory exists and creates an empty configuration file if it does not already exist. Finally, it returns the complete path to the configuration file.\\n\\nRelationship with Callers:\\nThe get_config_path function is called by other functions within the config_manager.py module, such as read_config and write_config. These functions rely on get_config_path to obtain the correct path to the configuration file before reading from or writing to it.\\n\\nNote:\\n- This function does not accept any parameters and operates based on the current working directory and the operating system to determine the configuration file path.\\n- It is essential to ensure that the necessary permissions are granted for the function to create or modify files in the specified configuration directory.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf the configuration file is located in the current working directory, the function will return a Path object representing the path to the config.toml file.\\n\\nFunctionDef read_config(file_path)\\n\\nread_config: The function of read_config is to read a configuration file specified by the file_path parameter or determine the path using get_config_path function if no file_path is provided, and return the contents of the configuration file as a dictionary.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- file_path: Optional parameter representing the path to the configuration file. If not provided, it defaults to None.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe read_config function first checks if a file_path is provided.

It then opens the configuration file, reads its contents using the tomli library, and returns the configuration data as a dictionary. In case of any decoding errors, an empty dictionary is returned.\\n\\nRelationship with Callers:\\nThe read_config function is typically called by other parts of the application that require access to configuration settings. It relies on the get_config_path function to obtain the correct path to the configuration file before reading its contents.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The read_config function can handle both cases where a file_path is provided and where it is not, ensuring flexibility in configuration file retrieval.\\n- It is important to handle any potential decoding errors that may occur when reading the configuration file.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf the configuration file contains the following data:\\npython\\n{\\n    \"key1\": \"value1\",\\n    \"key2\": 123,\\n    \"key3\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\\n}\\nThe read_config function will return:\\npython\\n{\\n    \"key1\": \"value1\",\\n    \"key2\": 123,\\n    \"key3\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\\n}\\n\\nFunctionDef write_config(update_config, file_path)\\n\\nwrite_config: The function of write_config is to update the existing configuration with new key-value pairs and write the updated configuration back to a file.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- update_config: A dictionary containing the new key-value pairs to be added or updated in the configuration.\\n- file_path: An optional parameter representing the path to the configuration file. If not provided, the function will determine the file path internally.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe write_config function first checks if a file path is provided. If not, it calls the get_config_path function to determine the configuration file path. It then reads the existing configuration from the file, updates it with the new key-value pairs from update_config, and writes the modified configuration back to the file in TOML format.\\n\\nThe function ensures that the configuration file is loaded correctly and handles cases where the file might not exist or is empty. By updating the existing configuration with the new values, it allows for dynamic changes to the application\\'s settings without losing previous configurations.\\n\\nRelationship with Callers:\\nThe write_config function is called by other parts of the project, such as the configure function in main.py, where it is used to save project and chat completion settings to the configuration file.

Each type represents a specific level of granularity, allowing for better organization and understanding of the project\\'s structure.\\n\\nThe class provides two methods: to_str() and print_self(). The to_str() method returns a string representation of the DocItemType, mapping the enum values to their corresponding string names. The print_self() method returns a colored string representation of the DocItemType, which is useful for printing the object type in a visually distinguishable manner.\\n\\nThe class also defines a get_edge_type() method, which is currently empty and does not have any implementation. This method is intended to determine the type of edge between two DocItemTypes, but its functionality is not yet implemented.\\n\\nThe DocItemType class is used throughout the project to categorize and identify different types of objects. It is primarily used in the DocItem class, where each DocItem object is assigned a specific DocItemType based on its role in the project hierarchy.\\n\\nNote: \\n- The to_str() method is used to convert the DocItemType enum values to their string representations, which can be useful for display purposes.\\n- The print_self() method is used to print the DocItemType with colored formatting, making it easier to visually distinguish different types of objects.\\n- The get_edge_type() method is currently empty and does not have any functionality implemented.

If none of these types match, it returns the name of the instance.\\n\\nThis function is called in different parts of the project to convert the DocItemType to a string representation for various purposes. For example, in the walk_file function in MetaInfo, the to_str function is used to set the type field in a JSON object. Similarly, in the to_markdown function in Runner, the to_str function is used to include the type of the item in the generated markdown content.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the DocItemType values are correctly defined to match the expected types in the to_str function.\\n- Handle any additional DocItemType values that may be added in the future to avoid unexpected behavior.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If self is of type _class, the function will return \"ClassDef\".\\n- If self is of type _function, _class_function, or _sub_function, the function will return \"FunctionDef\".\\n- If self is of a different type, the function will return the name of the instance.\\n\\nFunctionDef print_self(self)\\n\\nprint_self: The function of print_self is to determine the color based on the type of the DocItemType and return the formatted string including the name of the DocItemType.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- self: The current instance of the class.\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe print_self function in the DocItemType class determines the color based on the type of DocItemType. It assigns a specific color to different types of DocItemType such as directory, file, class, function, sub-function, and class function. The function then returns the formatted string including the name of the DocItemType with the assigned color.\\n\\nIn the calling situation, the print_self function is utilized within the print_recursive function of the DocItem class. It is used to print the type of the item along with its name, and in case of a specified condition, the item status as well. This function helps in recursively printing the repository objects with proper indentation and formatting.\\n\\nNote: \\nDevelopers can use this function to display different types of DocItemType with distinct colors for better visualization and understanding.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\nIf the DocItemType is a directory, the output may look like: \"\\\\x1b[32m_dir\\\\x1b[0m: directory_name\"\\n\\nFunctionDef get_edge_type(self, from_item_type, to_item_type)\\n\\nget_edge_type: The function of get_edge_type is to retrieve the edge type between two specified item types.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- from_item_type: Represents the source item type for which the edge type needs to be determined.\\n- to_item_type: Represents the target item type for which the edge type needs to be determined.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_edge_type function takes two parameters, from_item_type and to_item_type, both of type DocItemType.

It provides a set of predefined status values that can be used to determine the state of a documentation item.\\n\\nThe DocItemStatus class is defined using the Enum class from the enum module. It has five attributes: doc_up_to_date, doc_has_not_been_generated, code_changed, add_new_referencer, and referencer_not_exist. Each attribute represents a specific status of a documentation item.\\n\\nThe doc_up_to_date attribute indicates that the documentation is up to date and does not need to be generated. The doc_has_not_been_generated attribute indicates that the documentation has not been generated yet and needs to be generated. The code_changed attribute indicates that the source code has been modified and the documentation needs to be updated. The add_new_referencer attribute indicates that a new object has referenced the documentation item. The referencer_not_exist attribute indicates that an object that previously referenced the documentation item has been deleted or no longer references it.\\n\\nThese attributes are defined using the auto() function from the enum module, which automatically assigns unique values to each attribute.\\n\\nThe DocItemStatus class is used in the project to determine the status of a documentation item and decide whether the documentation needs to be generated or updated. It is used in the need_to_generate function in the repo_agent\\\\doc_meta_info.py/need_to_generate module to check the status of a documentation item and determine whether it needs to be generated based on its status and other conditions.\\n\\nThe DocItemStatus class is also used in other parts of the project, such as the MetaInfo class in the repo_agent\\\\doc_meta_info.py/MetaInfo module, to handle the status of documentation items during the generation process.\\n\\nNote: The DocItemStatus class provides a convenient way to represent the status of a documentation item and determine whether it needs to be generated or updated based on its status. It is an essential component of the documentation generation process in the project.\\n\\nFunctionDef need_to_generate(doc_item, ignore_list)\\n\\nneed_to_generate: The function of need_to_generate is to determine whether a documentation item needs to be generated based on its status and other conditions.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- doc_item: A DocItem object representing the documentation item to be checked.\\n- ignore_list (optional): A list of file paths to be ignored. The default value is an empty list.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe need_to_generate function takes a DocItem object and an optional ignore_list as input parameters. It first checks the status of the doc_item. If the item_status attribute of the doc_item is DocItemStatus.doc_up_to_date, indicating that the documentation is already up to date, the function returns False.\\n\\nNext, the function retrieves the relative file path of the doc_item using the get_full_name method. If the item_type attribute of the doc_item is one of [DocItemType._file, DocItemType._dir, DocItemType._repo], which represents file or higher granularity levels, the function returns False. This means that the function does not generate documentation for files or higher-level objects.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through the parent objects of the doc_item using a while loop. It checks if the current parent object is a file (DocItemType._file). If it is, the function checks if the relative file path starts with any item in the ignore_list. If it does, indicating that the current file is in the ignore_list or under a path in the ignore_list, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.\\n\\nIf the while loop completes without finding a file parent object, the function returns False.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The need_to_generate function is used to determine whether a documentation item needs to be generated based on its status and other conditions.\\n- It checks the status of the item and skips generation if the item is already up to date.\\n- It skips generation for file or higher-level objects.\\n- It checks if the current file is in the ignore_list or under a path in the ignore_list and skips generation if it is.\\n- The ignore_list parameter is optional and can be used to specify file paths to be ignored during generation.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If doc_item.item_status is DocItemStatus.doc_up_to_date: False\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._file: False\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._dir: False\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._repo: False\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._class and rel_file_path is not in ignore_list: True\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._class and rel_file_path is in ignore_list: False\\n\\nClassDef DocItem\\n\\nAn unknown error occurred while generating this documentation after many tries.\\n\\nFunctionDef has_ans_relation(now_a, now_b)\\n\\nhas_ans_relation: The function of has_ans_relation is to check if there is an ancestor relationship between two nodes and return the earlier node if it exists.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_a (DocItem): The first node.\\n- now_b (DocItem): The second node.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe has_ans_relation function takes two DocItem objects as input, representing nodes in a tree structure. It checks if there is an ancestor relationship between the two nodes by examining their tree paths. If an ancestor relationship exists, the function returns the earlier node; otherwise, it returns None.\\n\\nIn the project, this function is called within the walk_file function of the MetaInfo class in the doc_meta_info.py file. Specifically, it is used to determine if there is an ancestor relationship between two nodes representing objects in a codebase. If such a relationship is not found, the function updates the references between the nodes accordingly.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the input parameters are valid DocItem objects representing nodes in a tree structure.\\n- The function only considers direct ancestor relationships between nodes.\\n- If no ancestor relationship is found, the function returns None.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n```python\\n\\nExample usage of has_ans_relation function\\n\\nnode_a = DocItem()\\nnode_b = DocItem()\\n\\nAssuming node_a is an ancestor of node_b\\n\\nresult = has_ans_relation(node_a, node_b)\\nprint(result)  # Output: node_a\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef get_travel_list(self)\\n\\nget_travel_list: The function of get_travel_list is to traverse the tree structure in a pre-order manner, with the root node being the first element in the resulting list.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- None\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe get_travel_list function recursively traverses the tree structure starting from the current node in a pre-order manner. It appends each node to the now_list, which is initially a list containing only the current node. The function then iterates over the children of the current node, recursively calls get_travel_list on each child, and concatenates the resulting lists to the now_list. Finally, it returns the now_list containing all nodes in the pre-order traversal sequence.\\n\\nIn the calling context of the project, the get_travel_list function is utilized within the get_task_manager method of the MetaInfo class. It is used to retrieve a list of DocItem nodes based on certain criteria specified by the task_available_func and white_list attributes of the MetaInfo instance. The retrieved list is further processed to create a task manager that manages tasks based on the dependencies between the DocItem nodes.\\n\\nNote: \\n- The get_travel_list function assumes a tree-like structure where each node has children.\\n- Ensure that the tree structure does not contain circular references to prevent potential issues during traversal.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\n[Node1, Node2, Node3, ...]\\n\\nFunctionDef check_depth(self)\\n\\ncheck_depth: The function of check_depth is to recursively calculate the depth of a node in a tree.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- No parameters are passed explicitly to this function. It operates on the object itself.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe check_depth function recursively determines the depth of a node in a tree structure. It first checks if the node has any children. If it does not have any children, the depth of the node is set to 0 and returned. If the node has children, it iterates through each child, recursively calling the check_depth function on each child to find the maximum depth among the children. Finally, the depth of the current node is set to the maximum child depth plus 1, representing the depth of the current node in the tree.\\n\\nIn the project, the check_depth function is called on the target repository hierarchical tree after constructing the tree from a JSON representation of the project hierarchy. This function call is part of the process to parse the tree structure and calculate the depth of each node in the tree.\\n\\nNote:\\nEnsure that the tree structure is properly constructed before calling check_depth to accurately calculate the depth of each node.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf the depth of a node in the tree is calculated to be 3, the function will return 3.\\n\\nFunctionDef parse_tree_path(self, now_path)\\n\\nparse_tree_path: The function of parse_tree_path is to recursively parse the tree path by appending the current node to the given path.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_path (list): The current path in the tree.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe parse_tree_path function takes a list now_path representing the current path in the tree. It appends the current node to the given path by setting self.tree_path to now_path concatenated with the current node. Then, it iterates through the children of the current node, calling parse_tree_path recursively on each child with the updated tree path.\\n\\nIn the project, this function is called within the from_project_hierarchy_json function in the MetaInfo class. After constructing the hierarchical tree structure based on the project hierarchy JSON, the parse_tree_path function is invoked on the root node of the tree to parse and update the tree paths for each node in the hierarchy. This step ensures that each node\\'s path accurately reflects its position within the tree structure.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The parse_tree_path function plays a crucial role in establishing the correct tree paths for nodes in the hierarchical structure, aiding in subsequent operations that rely on accurate path information.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_file_name(self)\\n\\nget_file_name: The function of get_file_name is to retrieve the file name of an object.\\n\\nparameters: This function does not take any parameters.\\n\\nCode Description: The get_file_name function is a method of the DocItem class. It is used to obtain the file name of an object by calling the get_full_name method and manipulating the returned value.\\n\\nThe function first calls the get_full_name method to retrieve the full name of the object, including all the names of its parent objects in a hierarchical manner. It then splits the full name using the \".py\" extension as the delimiter, and takes the first part of the split result. Finally, it concatenates the first part with the \".py\" extension to form the file name of the object.\\n\\nThe purpose of this function is to provide a convenient way to obtain the file name of an object without the need to manually manipulate the full name string.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\nIf the full name of the object is \"repo_agent/doc_meta_info.py/DocItem/get_file_name\", the function will return \"repo_agent/doc_meta_info.py\".\\n\\nFunctionDef get_full_name(self, strict)\\n\\nget_full_name: The function of get_full_name is to retrieve the full name of an object, including all the names of its parent objects in a hierarchical manner.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- strict (optional): A boolean value indicating whether to include the names of objects with name duplicates. The default value is False.\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe get_full_name function is used to obtain the full name of an object by traversing from the current object to its parent objects. The function starts by checking if the current object has a parent. If it does not have a parent, it returns the object\\'s own name. Otherwise, it creates an empty list to store the names of the objects in the hierarchy.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through each object in the hierarchy, starting from the current object and moving up to its parent objects. For each object, it retrieves the object\\'s name and checks if the strict parameter is set to True. If strict is True, it checks if there are any other objects with the same name in the parent object\\'s children. If there is a duplicate name, it appends \"(name_duplicate_version)\" to the object\\'s name.\\n\\nThe function adds the object\\'s name to the name_list and updates the current object to its parent object. This process continues until there are no more parent objects.\\n\\nFinally, the function removes the first element from the name_list (which is the current object\\'s name) and joins the remaining names with a forward slash (\"/\") to create the full name of the object. The function returns the full name as a string.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\nIf the object hierarchy is as follows:\\n- Object A\\n  - Object B\\n    - Object C\\n\\nCalling get_full_name on Object C would return \"A/B/C\".\\n\\nNote: \\n- The strict parameter is optional and defaults to False. When set to True, it includes the names of objects with name duplicates in the full name.\\n\\nFunctionDef find(self, recursive_file_path)\\n\\nfind: The function of find is to search for a specific file in the repository hierarchy based on a given list of file paths.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- recursive_file_path (list): The list of file paths to search for.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe find function is a method of the DocItem class. It is used to search for a specific file in the repository hierarchy based on a given list of file paths. The function takes in a parameter recursive_file_path, which is a list of file paths representing the path to the desired file.\\n\\nThe function starts by asserting that the item_type of the current DocItem object is equal to DocItemType._repo, which represents the root node of the documentation hierarchy. This ensures that the function is called on the correct type of object.\\n\\nNext, the function initializes a variable pos to 0 and a variable now to the current DocItem object. These variables will be used to keep track of the current position in the recursive_file_path list and the current DocItem object in the hierarchy.\\n\\nThe function then enters a while loop that iterates until pos is less than the length of the recursive_file_path list. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current file path at index pos exists as a key in the children dictionary of the current DocItem object. If the file path does not exist, the function returns None, indicating that the file was not found in the hierarchy. If the file path does exist, the function updates the now variable to the corresponding child DocItem object and increments pos by 1.\\n\\nOnce the while loop completes, the function returns the final value of now, which represents the DocItem object corresponding to the desired file.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The function assumes that the item_type of the current DocItem object is DocItemType._repo. If this is not the case, an assertion error will be raised.\\n- The function expects the recursive_file_path parameter to be a list of file paths. If a different type of input is provided, the behavior of the function may be unpredictable.\\n- If the file is not found in the hierarchy, the function returns None.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If the file is found in the hierarchy, the function returns the corresponding DocItem object.\\n- If the file is not found in the hierarchy, the function returns None.\\n\\nFunctionDef check_has_task(now_item, ignore_list)\\n\\ncheck_has_task: The function of check_has_task is to recursively check if a documentation item or its children require task generation based on certain conditions.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_item: A DocItem object representing the current documentation item to be checked.\\n- ignore_list (optional): A list of file paths to be ignored during the task generation process. The default value is an empty list.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe check_has_task function takes a DocItem object and an optional ignore_list as input parameters. It first calls the need_to_generate function to determine if the current documentation item needs task generation. If task generation is needed, it sets the has_task attribute of the current item to True.\\n\\nNext, the function iterates through the children of the current item recursively. For each child, it calls check_has_task recursively to check if the child or its descendants require task generation. It then updates the has_task attribute of the current item based on the has_task attribute of its children.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The check_has_task function is used to determine if a documentation item or its children require task generation.\\n- It utilizes the need_to_generate function to check if task generation is necessary for a specific item.\\n- The function recursively checks through the hierarchy of documentation items to update the has_task attribute accordingly.\\n\\nFunctionDef print_recursive(self, indent, print_content, diff_status, ignore_list)\\n\\nprint_recursive: The function of print_recursive is to recursively print the repository objects with proper indentation and formatting.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the class.\\n- indent (optional): An integer representing the current level of indentation. The default value is 0.\\n- print_content (optional): A boolean indicating whether to print the content of the objects. The default value is False.\\n- diff_status (optional): A boolean indicating whether to print the difference status of the objects. The default value is False.\\n- ignore_list (optional): A list of strings representing file paths to be ignored during printing. The default value is an empty list.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe print_recursive function is a recursive function that prints the repository objects in a hierarchical manner. It takes several optional parameters to control the printing behavior.\\n\\nThe function first defines a nested helper function called print_indent, which is used to generate the indentation string based on the current level of indentation. The indentation string is calculated by multiplying the indent parameter by two spaces and adding a \"|-\" character at the beginning.\\n\\nNext, the function determines the name to be printed for the current object. If the item_type attribute of the current object is DocItemType._repo, the name is set to the target repository name specified in the setting.project.target_repo variable. Otherwise, the name is set to the obj_name attribute of the current object.\\n\\nIf the diff_status parameter is True and the need_to_generate function returns True for the current object, indicating that the documentation needs to be generated or updated, the function prints the object type, name, and item status using the print_indent function for indentation.\\n\\nIf the diff_status parameter is False or the need_to_generate function returns False, the function prints only the object type and name using the print_indent function for indentation.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through the children of the current object and recursively calls the print_recursive function on each child, incrementing the indent parameter by 1. If the diff_status parameter is True and the child object does not have a task, indicating that it does not need to be generated or updated, the function skips printing the child.\\n\\nThe print_recursive function is primarily used in the print_hierarchy function and the diff function in the main.py file. In the print_hierarchy function, it is called on the target_repo_hierarchical_tree object of the MetaInfo class to print the hierarchy of the target repository. In the diff function, it is called on the target_repo_hierarchical_tree object of the new_meta_info variable to print the documents that will be generated or updated.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The print_recursive function is used to recursively print the repository objects with proper indentation and formatting.\\n- It takes several optional parameters to control the printing behavior, such as the level of indentation, whether to print the content of the objects, whether to print the difference status of the objects, and a list of file paths to be ignored during printing.\\n- The function uses the print_indent helper function to generate the indentation string.\\n- It determines the name to be printed for each object based on its item_type attribute.\\n- The function checks the diff_status parameter and the result of the need_to_generate function to decide whether to print the object\\'s item status.\\n- It recursively calls itself on the children of each object to print the hierarchy.\\n- The print_recursive function is called in the print_hierarchy and diff functions in the main.py file to print the hierarchy of the target repository and the documents that will be generated or updated, respectively.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n|-_dir: directory_name\\n  |-_file: file_name\\n    |-_class: class_name\\n      |-_function: function_name\\n      |-_sub_function: sub_function_name\\n  |-_file: file_name\\n    |-_class: class_name\\n      |-_class_function: class_function_name\\n\\nFunctionDef print_indent(indent)\\n\\nprint_indent: The function of print_indent is to generate an indented string with a specified number of spaces.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- indent: An integer representing the number of spaces for indentation.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe print_indent function takes an integer parameter called indent. If the indent value is 0, the function returns an empty string. Otherwise, it generates an indented string by concatenating the string \"  \" (two spaces) multiplied by the indent value, followed by \"|-\".\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the indent parameter is a non-negative integer to avoid any unexpected behavior.\\n- The function does not handle negative values for the indent parameter.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf print_indent(3) is called, the output will be \"      |-\".\\n\\nFunctionDef find_all_referencer(repo_path, variable_name, file_path, line_number, column_number, in_file_only)\\n\\nfind_all_referencer: The function of find_all_referencer is to locate all references to a specific variable in a given script file.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- repo_path: The path to the repository.\\n- variable_name: The name of the variable to search for.\\n- file_path: The path to the script file.\\n- line_number: The line number where the variable is located.\\n- column_number: The column number where the variable is located.\\n- in_file_only: A boolean flag to indicate whether to search for references only within the same file.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe find_all_referencer function utilizes the Jedi library to analyze the script file specified by file_path in the repository located at repo_path. It searches for references to the variable with the name variable_name at the provided line_number and column_number. If in_file_only is set to True, it restricts the search scope to the current file. The function then filters out references that match the variable_name and returns a list of tuples containing the relative path of the referencing file, line number, and column number. If an error occurs during the process, it logs the error message along with the relevant parameters and returns an empty list.\\n\\nIn the calling context, the function walk_file in the MetaInfo class iterates through variables in a file, calling find_all_referencer to identify references to each variable. It processes the reference list, skipping references from unstaged or untracked files, and handles references within the target repository\\'s hierarchical structure. Additionally, it manages special reference types and relationships between objects based on the references found.\\n\\nNote: Developers should ensure that the necessary parameters are provided correctly to execute the function successfully.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n[(\\'path/to/referencing_file.py\\', 10, 5), (\\'path/to/another_file.py\\', 20, 15)]\\n\\nClassDef MetaInfo\\n\\nMetaInfo: The MetaInfo class represents the metadata information for the documentation generation process. It stores various attributes and methods related to the generation and management of documentation.\\n\\nAttributes:\\n- repo_path: A string representing the path to the target repository.\\n- document_version: A string representing the version of the document. It is updated with the commit hash of the target repository.\\n- target_repo_hierarchical_tree: A DocItem object representing the hierarchical structure of the repository.\\n- white_list: A list of objects to be included in the documentation generation process.\\n- fake_file_reflection: A dictionary mapping fake file paths to their corresponding real file paths.\\n- jump_files: A list of file paths that are skipped during the documentation generation process.\\n- deleted_items_from_older_meta: A list of items (directories, files, or objects) that have been deleted from the previous version of the metadata.\\n- in_generation_process: A boolean value indicating whether the documentation generation process is currently in progress.\\n- checkpoint_lock: A threading lock used to ensure thread safety during the checkpointing process.\\n\\nMethods:\\n- init_meta_info(file_path_reflections, jump_files): Initializes the MetaInfo object from a repository path by generating the overall structure and setting the fake file reflections and jump files.\\n- from_checkpoint_path(checkpoint_dir_path): Loads the MetaInfo object from a checkpoint directory path, including the project hierarchy and metadata.\\n- checkpoint(target_dir_path, flash_reference_relation=False): Saves the MetaInfo object to the specified directory, including the project hierarchy and metadata.\\n- print_task_list(task_dict): Prints the remaining tasks to be done during the documentation generation process.\\n- get_all_files(): Returns a list of all file nodes in the repository.\\n- find_obj_with_lineno(file_node, start_line_num): Finds the object in the repository hierarchy that corresponds to the given file node and starting line number.\\n- parse_reference(): Parses the bidirectional reference relationships between objects in the repository.\\n- get_task_manager(now_node, task_available_func): Returns a TaskManager object that manages the tasks for generating documentation based on the given node and task availability function.\\n- get_topology(task_available_func): Calculates the topological order of objects in the repository based on the task availability function.\\n- load_doc_from_older_meta(older_meta): Loads the documentation from the older version of the metadata and merges it with the current metadata.\\n- from_project_hierarchy_path(repo_path): Creates a MetaInfo object from the project hierarchy JSON file.\\n- to_hierarchy_json(flash_reference_relation=False): Converts the metadata to a hierarchical JSON representation.\\n- from_project_hierarchy_json(project_hierarchy_json): Creates a MetaInfo object from the project hierarchy JSON dictionary.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe MetaInfo class is responsible for managing the metadata information related to the documentation generation process. It contains attributes to store information such as the repository path, document version, repository hierarchy, white list, fake file reflections, jump files, deleted items from the older metadata, and the status of the generation process.\\n\\nThe class provides methods to initialize the metadata from a repository path, load the metadata from a checkpoint directory, save the metadata to a directory, print the remaining tasks, get all file nodes in the repository, find the object corresponding to a file node and line number, parse the bidirectional reference relationships, calculate the topological order of objects, merge the documentation from the older metadata, convert the metadata to a hierarchical JSON representation, and create a MetaInfo object from the project hierarchy JSON.\\n\\nThe MetaInfo class plays a crucial role in managing the documentation generation process. It handles the detection of changes in the repository, generates and updates the documentation based on the changes, and maintains the metadata information for efficient generation and management of the documentation.\\n\\nNote: The MetaInfo class is used in conjunction with other classes and functions in the repository agent project to facilitate the generation and management of documentation. It is designed to be thread-safe and supports multi-threaded documentation generation.\\n\\nOutput Example: N/A\\n\\nFunctionDef init_meta_info(file_path_reflections, jump_files)\\n\\ninit_meta_info: The function of init_meta_info is to initialize the MetaInfo object by parsing the file structure and generating the hierarchical representation of the target repository.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- file_path_reflections (dict): A dictionary mapping the original file paths to their corresponding fake file paths.\\n- jump_files (list): A list of file paths to be ignored during parsing.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe init_meta_info function takes in the file_path_reflections and jump_files parameters. It first retrieves the absolute path of the target repository and prints a message indicating the initialization process.\\n\\nNext, it creates a FileHandler object with the project absolute path and None as the file path. It then calls the generate_overall_structure method of the FileHandler object to generate the overall structure of the repository. This method reads the project hierarchy JSON file, checks for ignored files, and generates the file structure for each file in the repository.\\n\\nAfter generating the repository structure, the function creates a new MetaInfo object and sets its attributes based on the generated structure. It assigns the project absolute path to the repo_path attribute and sets the fake_file_reflection and jump_files attributes to the provided parameters.\\n\\nFinally, the function returns the initialized metainfo object.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The init_meta_info function is a crucial step in initializing the MetaInfo object and constructing the hierarchical representation of the target repository.\\n- It relies on the FileHandler class to generate the overall structure of the repository.\\n- The file_path_reflections parameter should be a dictionary mapping the original file paths to their corresponding fake file paths.\\n- The jump_files parameter should be a list of file paths to be ignored during parsing.\\n- The returned metainfo object represents the hierarchical structure of the project and contains information about the repository path, fake file reflections, and jump files.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA MetaInfo object representing the hierarchical structure of the project.\\n\\nFunctionDef from_checkpoint_path(checkpoint_dir_path)\\n\\nfrom_checkpoint_path: The function of from_checkpoint_path is to read meta-information from an existing checkpoint directory and populate a MetaInfo object with the retrieved data.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- checkpoint_dir_path (str | Path): The path to the checkpoint directory containing the meta-information.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe from_checkpoint_path function reads the project_hierarchy.json and meta-info.json files from the specified checkpoint directory. It then extracts relevant meta-data from meta-info.json and assigns it to the corresponding attributes of the MetaInfo object. The function sets attributes such as repo_path, document_version, fake_file_reflection, jump_files, in_generation_process, and deleted_items_from_older_meta based on the data retrieved from meta-info.json.\\n\\nAdditionally, the function prints a message indicating the loading of MetaInfo from the checkpoint directory before returning the populated MetaInfo object.\\n\\nThis function relies on the MetaInfo class and the from_project_hierarchy_json function to construct and populate the MetaInfo object with hierarchical project information.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the checkpoint directory contains the necessary project_hierarchy.json and meta-info.json files for successful extraction of meta-information.\\n- The function assumes the presence of valid data in the meta-info.json file to populate the MetaInfo object accurately.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA MetaInfo object representing the meta-information loaded from the specified checkpoint directory.\\n\\nFunctionDef checkpoint(self, target_dir_path, flash_reference_relation)\\n\\ncheckpoint: The function of checkpoint is to save the MetaInfo object to the specified directory.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- target_dir_path (str): The path to the target directory where the MetaInfo will be saved.\\n- flash_reference_relation (bool, optional): Whether to include flash reference relation in the saved MetaInfo. Defaults to False.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe checkpoint function is responsible for saving the MetaInfo object to the specified directory. It performs several operations to store the MetaInfo and related information.\\n\\nFirst, the function acquires a lock using the checkpoint_lock attribute to ensure thread safety during the saving process. This prevents multiple threads from accessing and modifying the MetaInfo simultaneously.\\n\\nNext, the function prints a message indicating that the MetaInfo is being refreshed and saved. This serves as a visual confirmation for developers.\\n\\nThe function then checks if the target directory exists. If it does not, the function creates the directory using the os.makedirs method.\\n\\nAfterward, the function calls the to_hierarchy_json method of the MetaInfo object to convert the document metadata to a hierarchical JSON representation. This method retrieves information about each file node in the metadata and constructs a structured JSON representation. The flash_reference_relation parameter determines whether to include bidirectional reference relations in the JSON output.\\n\\nThe resulting hierarchical JSON representation is then written to a file named \"project_hierarchy.json\" in the target directory. This is achieved by opening the file in write mode using the open function, and then using the json.dump method to write the JSON data to the file. The indent parameter is set to 2 to format the JSON with indentation, and the ensure_ascii parameter is set to False to preserve non-ASCII characters.\\n\\nAdditionally, the function saves specific meta information to a separate file named \"meta-info.json\" in the target directory. This file contains information such as the document version, generation process status, fake file reflection, jump files, and deleted items from older meta. The meta information is stored in a dictionary and written to the file using the same process as the project hierarchy JSON file.\\n\\nOverall, the checkpoint function ensures that the MetaInfo object and related information are saved to the specified directory in a structured manner. This allows developers to persist and access the document metadata for future use.\\n\\nNote: Developers can use this function to save the MetaInfo object and associated metadata to a directory. This can be useful for storing and retrieving document information, such as object details, references, and version history.\\n\\nNote: The checkpoint function relies on the to_hierarchy_json method to convert the document metadata to a hierarchical JSON representation. It is recommended to call the checkpoint function after making any changes to the MetaInfo object to ensure that the updated information is saved.\\n\\nFunctionDef print_task_list(self, task_dict)\\n\\nprint_task_list: The function of print_task_list is to display a table of task information including task ID, generation reason, path, and dependencies.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- task_dict: A dictionary containing Task objects with task information.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe print_task_list function utilizes the PrettyTable library to create a table displaying task details. It iterates over the task_dict dictionary, extracting task ID, generation reason, path, and dependencies for each task. The dependencies are formatted as a string with a maximum length of 20 characters, showing a truncated list if longer. The function then prints the task table to the console.\\n\\nThis function is called within the Runner class in the run method to print the task list before processing tasks for document generation. It provides a clear overview of the tasks to be executed, aiding in task management and tracking during the document update process.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure the task_dict parameter contains Task objects with the required information for accurate table generation.\\n- The function output is displayed in a tabular format for easy readability and task tracking.\\n- Utilizes the PrettyTable library for table creation, requiring the library to be installed for proper functionality.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_all_files(self)\\n\\nget_all_files: The function of get_all_files is to retrieve all file nodes from the target repository hierarchical tree.\\n\\nParameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the MetaInfo class.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_all_files function starts by initializing an empty list called \"files\". It then defines a nested function called \"walk_tree\" that takes a node as an argument. The purpose of this function is to recursively traverse the hierarchical tree and append any file nodes to the \"files\" list.\\n\\nInside the \"walk_tree\" function, it checks if the current node\\'s item_type is equal to DocItemType._file. If it is, it appends the node to the \"files\" list. Then, it iterates over the children of the current node and recursively calls the \"walk_tree\" function for each child.\\n\\nAfter defining the \"walk_tree\" function, the get_all_files function calls it with the target_repo_hierarchical_tree as the starting node. This initiates the recursive traversal of the tree and populates the \"files\" list with all file nodes.\\n\\nFinally, the function returns the \"files\" list containing all the file nodes.\\n\\nNote:\\n- This function assumes that the target_repo_hierarchical_tree is a valid hierarchical tree structure.\\n- The function expects the target_repo_hierarchical_tree to have a \"children\" attribute that is a dictionary of child nodes.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n[<DocItem object at 0x000001>, <DocItem object at 0x000002>, ...]\\n\\nFunctionDef walk_tree(now_node)\\n\\nwalk_tree: The function of walk_tree is to recursively traverse a tree structure starting from a given node and collect all the leaf nodes of type _file.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_node: Represents the current node being traversed in the tree structure.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe walk_tree function takes a now_node as input and checks if the node\\'s item_type is of type _file. If it is a file node, the function appends the node to the files list. Then, the function recursively calls itself on each child node of the current node until all leaf nodes of type _file are collected.\\n\\nThe function utilizes a depth-first search approach to traverse the tree structure, ensuring that all leaf nodes of type _file are visited and added to the files list.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The walk_tree function is crucial for collecting all file nodes within a hierarchical tree structure, making it a fundamental part of the document processing workflow in the project.\\n\\nFunctionDef find_obj_with_lineno(self, file_node, start_line_num)\\n\\nfind_obj_with_lineno: The function of find_obj_with_lineno is to find the DocItem object that corresponds to a specific line number within a file.\\n\\nParameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the class.\\n- file_node: A DocItem object representing the file in which to search for the line number.\\n- start_line_num: An integer representing the line number to search for.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe find_obj_with_lineno function takes in a file_node, which is a DocItem object representing a file, and a start_line_num, which is the line number to search for within the file. The function iterates through the children of the file_node to find the DocItem object that corresponds to the given line number. It does this by checking if the start_line_num falls within the range of the child\\'s code_start_line and code_end_line. If a qualifying child is found, the function updates the now_node to the child and continues the search. If no qualifying child is found, the function returns the current now_node.\\n\\nThe function starts by assigning the file_node to the now_node variable. It then enters a while loop that continues until there are no more children to search. Within the loop, it iterates through the children of the now_node and checks if the start_line_num falls within the range of the child\\'s code_start_line and code_end_line. If a qualifying child is found, the now_node is updated to the child and the find_qualify_child flag is set to True. This ensures that the loop continues to search for children within the new now_node. If no qualifying child is found, the function returns the current now_node.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The assert statement is used to ensure that the now_node is not None before entering the while loop.\\n- The function assumes that the file_node and its children have the necessary attributes (code_start_line, code_end_line) to perform the line number comparison.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA DocItem object representing the code block that corresponds to the given line number within the file.\\n\\nFunctionDef parse_reference(self)\\n\\nparse_reference: The function of parse_reference is to extract bidirectional reference relationships for all objects.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the object.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe parse_reference function is a method of the MetaInfo class. It is used to extract bidirectional reference relationships for all objects in the target repository. The function starts by calling the get_all_files method to retrieve all file nodes from the target repository hierarchical tree.\\n\\nNext, the function initializes two empty lists, white_list_file_names and white_list_obj_names, which will be used to store the names of files and objects in a whitelist. If a whitelist is specified, the function populates these lists with the corresponding names from the whitelist.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through each file node in the file_nodes list. For each file node, it performs the following steps:\\n\\nIt checks if the file node\\'s full name ends with a specific substring (latest_verison_substring). If it does, it raises an assertion error.\\n\\nIt retrieves the relative file path of the file node.\\n\\nIt checks if the relative file path is present in the jump_files list. If it is, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nIf the white_list_file_names list is not empty and the file node\\'s file name is not present in the white_list_file_names list, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nIt defines a nested function called walk_file, which takes a DocItem object as an argument. This function is used to traverse all variables within a file.\\n\\nInside the walk_file function, it first checks if the white_list_obj_names list is not empty and the current object\\'s name is not present in the white_list_obj_names list. If it is, it sets the in_file_only variable to True. This variable is used to indicate that only references within the same file should be considered.\\n\\nIt calls the find_all_referencer function to find all references to the current object within the file. The function takes several parameters, including the repository path, variable name, file path, line number, column number, and in_file_only flag. It returns a list of reference positions.\\n\\nFor each reference position in the reference_list, the function performs the following steps:\\n\\na. It retrieves the file path of the referencer.\\n\\nb. It checks if the referencer file path is present in the fake_file_reflection dictionary. If it is, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nc. It checks if the referencer file path is present in the jump_files list. If it is, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nd. It splits the referencer file path into a list of hierarchical levels.\\n\\ne. It calls the find method on the target_repo_hierarchical_tree to find the referencer file item based on the hierarchical levels. If the file item is not found, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration.\\n\\nf. It calls the find_obj_with_lineno method to find the referencer node within the referencer file item based on the line number. If the node\\'s name is the same as the current object\\'s name, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\ng. It checks if there is an ancestor relationship between the current object and the referencer node. If there is, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nh. It checks if the referencer node is already in the reference_who list of the current object. If it is not, it appends the referencer node to the reference_who list and appends the current object to the who_reference_me list of the referencer node. It also increments the ref_count variable.\\n\\nFinally, the function calls the walk_file function for each child of the file_node.\\n\\nAfter iterating through all file nodes, the function returns the ref_count variable, which represents the total number of bidirectional reference relationships found.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The parse_reference function assumes that the target repository hierarchical tree is a valid hierarchical tree structure.\\n- The function relies on the get_all_files, find_all_referencer, find_obj_with_lineno, and find methods to retrieve relevant information from the target repository.\\n- The function uses the white_list_file_names and white_list_obj_names lists to filter the objects for which bidirectional reference relationships are extracted.\\n- The function prints certain messages during the execution, which can provide additional information for debugging purposes.\\n\\nFunctionDef walk_file(now_obj)\\n\\nwalk_file: The walk_file function is responsible for traversing all variables within a file and finding their references.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_obj (DocItem): The current DocItem object representing the variable to be traversed.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe walk_file function is a recursive function that takes a DocItem object as input and traverses all variables within a file. It starts by checking if there is a whitelist of object names and if the current object is not in the whitelist. If this condition is met, the function sets the in_file_only flag to True, indicating that only references within the same file should be considered.\\n\\nThe function then calls the find_all_referencer function to find all references to the current variable. It passes the repository path, variable name, file path, line number, column number, and in_file_only flag as parameters. The find_all_referencer function utilizes the Jedi library to analyze the script file and returns a list of tuples containing the referencing file\\'s relative path, line number, and column number.\\n\\nNext, the function iterates through the reference list and performs the following checks for each reference:\\n- If the reference is from an unstaged file (not yet committed to the repository), it skips the reference and prints a message indicating that it is from an unstaged version.\\n- If the reference is from an untracked file (not yet added to the repository), it skips the reference and prints a message indicating that it is from an untracked version.\\n- If the reference is from a file that is reflected in the repository hierarchy (fake file), it skips the reference.\\n- If the reference is from a file that is not found in the target repository, it prints an error message indicating that the file is not in the repository.\\n\\nFor each valid reference, the function retrieves the corresponding DocItem object from the repository hierarchy using the file\\'s hierarchical path. It then checks if the referencer node has the same name as the current object. If they have the same name, it skips the reference.\\n\\nIf there is no ancestor relationship between the current object and the referencer node, the function adds the referencer node to the reference_who list of the current object and adds the current object to the who_reference_me list of the referencer node. It also increments the ref_count variable to keep track of the number of references.\\n\\nFinally, the function recursively calls itself for each child of the current object to traverse all variables within the file.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The walk_file function is called within the MetaInfo class in the doc_meta_info.py file.\\n- The function relies on the find_all_referencer function to locate references to variables.\\n- It handles different types of references, skips certain types of references, and updates the reference relationships between objects.\\n- The function uses various flags and variables to control the traversal and reference tracking process.\\n- It prints messages for skipped references and error messages for files not found in the repository.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_task_manager(self, now_node, task_available_func)\\n\\nget_task_manager: The function of get_task_manager is to generate a TaskManager object that manages tasks based on the topology of objects in the repository.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self (object): The current instance of the MetaInfo class.\\n- now_node (DocItem): The current DocItem node representing the starting point for generating the task manager.\\n- task_available_func (function): A function that determines if a DocItem node is available for task generation.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_task_manager function is responsible for generating a TaskManager object that manages tasks based on the topology of objects in the repository. The function takes in the current instance of the MetaInfo class, the starting DocItem node (now_node), and a task_available_func function as parameters.\\n\\nThe function begins by retrieving a list of DocItem nodes using the get_travel_list method of the now_node. This method performs a pre-order traversal of the tree structure, with the root node being the first element in the resulting list. The list of DocItem nodes is then filtered based on the white_list attribute of the MetaInfo instance, if it is not None. The in_white_list function is used to filter the DocItem nodes based on their file path and ID text.\\n\\nNext, the doc_items list is further filtered using the task_available_func function. This function determines if a DocItem node is available for task generation based on certain criteria. The filtered doc_items list is then sorted based on the depth of the DocItem nodes, with leaf nodes appearing first.\\n\\nThe function initializes an empty deal_items list to keep track of processed DocItem nodes and creates a TaskManager object. It also initializes a progress bar using the tqdm library to display the progress of parsing the topology task-list.\\n\\nThe function enters a while loop that continues until all DocItem nodes in the doc_items list have been processed. Within the loop, the function searches for the DocItem node with the minimum break level. The break level represents the number of dependencies that need to be resolved before the DocItem node can be processed. If a DocItem node has a break level of 0, it means that it has no unresolved dependencies and can be processed immediately.\\n\\nFor each DocItem node, the function calculates the break level by counting the number of dependencies on its children and referenced nodes. The break level is divided into two parts: the best_break_level, which includes all dependencies, and the second_best_break_level, which excludes special references. The function then selects the DocItem node with the minimum second_best_break_level as the target_item.\\n\\nIf the minimum break level is greater than 0, it means that there is a circular reference or unresolved dependency. The function prints a warning message indicating the level and name of the target_item.\\n\\nThe function then retrieves the task IDs of the DocItem node\\'s children and referenced nodes from the task_manager. These task IDs represent the dependencies of the target_item. If the task_available_func is None or returns True for the target_item, a new task is added to the task_manager with the retrieved task IDs as dependencies. The target_item is marked with the task ID and added to the deal_items list. Finally, the target_item is removed from the doc_items list, and the progress bar is updated.\\n\\nOnce all DocItem nodes have been processed, the function returns the task_manager.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The get_task_manager function assumes a hierarchical tree structure of DocItem nodes.\\n- Circular references or unresolved dependencies may occur in the tree structure, and the function handles them by selecting the DocItem node with the best break level.\\n- The task_available_func function is used to filter DocItem nodes based on certain criteria. It determines if a DocItem node is available for task generation.\\n- Ensure proper synchronization when accessing and modifying tasks in a multi-threaded environment.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA TaskManager object that manages tasks based on the topology of objects in the repository.\\n\\nFunctionDef in_white_list(item)\\n\\nin_white_list: The function of in_white_list is to check if an item is in the white list based on its file name and object name.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- item: Represents the item to be checked against the white list.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe in_white_list function iterates through the white_list attribute of the current object. It compares the file name and object name of the input item with the corresponding values in each element of the white list. If a match is found, the function returns True, indicating that the item is in the white list. If no match is found after iterating through all elements, the function returns False.\\n\\nThis function is essential for determining whether a specific item is allowed based on predefined criteria stored in the white list. It provides a mechanism to control access or perform specific actions on items based on their file name and object name.\\n\\nNote: It is crucial to ensure that the white_list attribute is correctly populated with the necessary file names and object names for accurate evaluation.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If the white list contains elements with file_path=\"example.py\" and id_text=\"example_id\", and the input item has a file name of \"example.py\" and an object name of \"example_id\", the function will return True.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_topology(self, task_available_func)\\n\\nget_topology: The function of get_topology is to calculate the topological order of all objects in the repository.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self (object): The current instance of the MetaInfo class.\\n- task_available_func (function): A function that determines if a DocItem node is available for task generation.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_topology function is responsible for calculating the topological order of all objects in the repository. It takes in the current instance of the MetaInfo class and a task_available_func function as parameters.\\n\\nThe function first calls the parse_reference method to extract bidirectional reference relationships for all objects in the repository. This method retrieves all file nodes from the target repository hierarchical tree and iterates through each file node to extract the references.\\n\\nNext, the function calls the get_task_manager method to generate a TaskManager object that manages tasks based on the topology of objects in the repository. This method retrieves a list of DocItem nodes using the get_travel_list method of the starting DocItem node. The list is then filtered based on the white_list attribute of the MetaInfo instance and the task_available_func function. The filtered list is sorted based on the depth of the DocItem nodes, with leaf nodes appearing first.\\n\\nThe function initializes a deal_items list to keep track of processed DocItem nodes and creates a TaskManager object. It also initializes a progress bar to display the progress of parsing the topology task-list.\\n\\nThe function enters a while loop that continues until all DocItem nodes in the list have been processed.

The function prints a warning message indicating the level and name of the target_item.\\n\\nThe function retrieves the task IDs of the DocItem node\\'s children and referenced nodes from the task_manager. These task IDs represent the dependencies of the target_item. If the task_available_func is None or returns True for the target_item, a new task is added to the task_manager with the retrieved task IDs as dependencies. The target_item is marked with the task ID and added to the deal_items list. Finally, the target_item is removed from the list, and the progress bar is updated.\\n\\nOnce all DocItem nodes have been processed, the function returns the task_manager.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The get_topology function assumes a hierarchical tree structure of DocItem nodes.\\n- Circular references or unresolved dependencies may occur in the tree structure, and the function handles them by selecting the DocItem node with the best break level.\\n- The task_available_func function is used to filter DocItem nodes based on certain criteria.

For each node visited, the deal_func function is called with the current node as an argument. Then, the function iterates over all child nodes of the current node and recursively applies the same operation to each child node.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the deal_func parameter is a valid Callable object that can accept a single argument representing a node in the hierarchical tree.\\n- Be cautious when using this function with large or deeply nested tree structures to avoid potential stack overflow issues.\\n\\nFunctionDef travel(now_item)\\n\\ntravel: The function of travel is to recursively traverse through the children of a given DocItem object and call the deal_func function on each child.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_item: Represents the current DocItem object being traversed.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe travel function takes a DocItem object as input and first calls the deal_func function on the current object. It then iterates through the children of the current object using a for loop and recursively calls the travel function on each child. This process continues until all children have been traversed.\\n\\nThe function essentially performs a depth-first traversal of the tree structure represented by the DocItem objects, visiting each node and its children in a systematic manner.\\n\\nFrom a functional perspective, the travel function is crucial for navigating through the hierarchical structure of DocItem objects, allowing for operations to be performed on each node and its children as needed.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The travel function relies on the deal_func function to process each DocItem object during traversal.\\n- It is important to ensure that the input now_item is a valid DocItem object to avoid any errors during traversal.\\n\\nFunctionDef load_doc_from_older_meta(self, older_meta)\\n\\nload_doc_from_older_meta: The function of load_doc_from_older_meta is to merge the documentation from an older version of the meta info into the current version.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- older_meta (MetaInfo): The meta info object representing the older version of the documentation.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe load_doc_from_older_meta function is a method of the MetaInfo class. It takes an older_meta object as a parameter, which represents the meta info of the older version of the documentation. The function merges the documentation from the older version into the current version.\\n\\nThe function starts by logging an informational message indicating that the documentation is being merged from an older version of the meta info. It then retrieves the root item of the new version of the meta info.\\n\\nNext, the function defines a nested function called find_item, which is used to find an item in the new version of the meta info based on its original item in the older version. This function takes a DocItem object as a parameter and returns the corresponding item in the new version of the meta info if found, otherwise it returns None.\\n\\nInside the find_item function, it checks if the current item is the root node. If it is, it returns the root item of the new version. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on the parent item of the current item until it finds the corresponding item in the new version.\\n\\nAfter defining the find_item function, the function defines another nested function called travel, which is used to traverse the items in the older version of the meta info and update the corresponding items in the new version. This function takes a DocItem object as a parameter.\\n\\nInside the travel function, it first calls the find_item function to find the corresponding item in the new version based on the current item in the older version. If the corresponding item is not found, it adds the current item to the deleted_items list and returns.\\n\\nIf the corresponding item is found, it updates the markdown content and status of the corresponding item in the new version based on the current item in the older version. If the code content of the current item in the older version is different from the code content of the corresponding item in the new version, it sets the status of the corresponding item to \"code_changed\".\\n\\nThen, it recursively calls the travel function on each child item of the current item in the older version.\\n\\nAfter defining the travel function, the function calls the travel function on the root item of the older version of the meta info to start the traversal process.\\n\\nNext, the function calls the parse_reference method of the current object to parse the reference relationships in the new version of the meta info.\\n\\nAfter that, the function defines another nested function called travel2, which is similar to the travel function but is used to update the reference relationships in the new version of the meta info. This function takes a DocItem object as a parameter.\\n\\nInside the travel2 function, it first calls the find_item function to find the corresponding item in the new version based on the current item in the older version.

If the lists are not equal and the status of the corresponding item in the new version is \"doc_up_to_date\", it updates the status of the corresponding item based on the changes in the reference relationships.\\n\\nFinally, it recursively calls the travel2 function on each child item of the current item in the older version.\\n\\nAfter defining the travel2 function, the function calls the travel2 function on the root item of the older version of the meta info to update the reference relationships in the new version.\\n\\nThe function stores the deleted items from the older version of the meta info in the deleted_items list.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The load_doc_from_older_meta function assumes that the target repository hierarchical tree is a valid hierarchical tree structure.\\n- The function relies on the find_item function to find the corresponding items in the new version of the meta info.\\n- The function uses the travel function to update the markdown content and status of the items in the new version based on the items in the older version.\\n- The function uses the travel2 function to update the reference relationships in the new version based on the reference relationships in the older version.\\n- The function calls the parse_reference method to extract bidirectional reference relationships for all objects in the new version of the meta info.\\n- The function updates the deleted_items_from_older_meta attribute of the current object with the deleted items from the older version of the meta info.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\ndeleted_items_from_older_meta: [[\\'item_name1\\', \\'item_type1\\'], [\\'item_name2\\', \\'item_type2\\'], ...]\\n\\nFunctionDef find_item(now_item)\\n\\nfind_item: The function of find_item is to search for an item in the new version of meta based on its original item.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_item (DocItem): The original item to be found in the new version of meta.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe find_item function recursively searches for an item in the new version of meta based on the provided original item. It traverses the meta structure to locate the corresponding item in the new version by comparing names and relationships. If the item is found, it returns the corresponding item; otherwise, it returns None.\\n\\nThe function first checks if the provided item is the root node. If it is, the root item is returned as the root node can always be found.

If the item is not found, it adds the name and type of the original item to a list of deleted items.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_older_item (DocItem): The original item to be found in the new version of meta.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe travel function is a recursive function that searches for an item in the new version of meta based on its original item. It takes the now_older_item parameter, which represents the original item to be found in the new version of meta.\\n\\nThe function first calls the find_item function to search for the corresponding item in the new version of meta. If the item is not found, it adds the name and type of the original item to a list of deleted items and returns. If the item is found, it updates the metadata of the result item with the metadata of the original item.\\n\\nNext, the function checks if the source code of the original item has been modified. It compares the code_content attribute of the original item with the code_content attribute of the result item. If the source code has been modified, it updates the item_status attribute of the result item to DocItemStatus.code_changed.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through the children of the original item and recursively calls the travel function for each child. This allows the function to traverse the entire hierarchy of the original item and update the corresponding items in the new version of meta.\\n\\nOverall, the travel function is responsible for updating the metadata of items in the new version of meta based on their original items. It ensures that the metadata remains consistent and up to date, especially when the source code has been modified.\\n\\nNote: It is important to note that the travel function relies on the find_item function to locate the corresponding item in the new version of meta. The find_item function recursively searches for an item by comparing names and relationships.

If the item is not found, the function returns.\\n\\nNext, the function compares the references of the result_item (the corresponding item in the new version) with the references of the now_older_item. It retrieves the names of the objects that reference the result_item and the now_older_item and stores them in new_reference_names and old_reference_names respectively.\\n\\nThe function then checks if the set of new_reference_names is different from the set of old_reference_names and if the result_item is up to date (item_status is DocItemStatus.doc_up_to_date). If both conditions are met, it further checks if the set of new_reference_names is a subset of the set of old_reference_names. If it is, it updates the item_status of the result_item to DocItemStatus.referencer_not_exist, indicating that some references to the item have been removed. Otherwise, it updates the item_status to DocItemStatus.add_new_referencer, indicating that new references to the item have been added.\\n\\nFinally, the function recursively calls itself for each child of the now_older_item to update their item_status as well.\\n\\nNote: The travel2 function is an important part of the documentation generation process in the project. It is responsible for updating the item_status of DocItem objects based on changes in their references. This helps to track the status of documentation items and determine whether they need to be generated or updated. Developers should ensure that the now_older_item parameter is a valid DocItem object to avoid unexpected behavior.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n```python\\n\\nExample usage of the travel2 function\\n\\nnow_older_item = DocItem(...)\\ntravel2(now_older_item)\\n\\nThe item_status of the DocItem objects in the hierarchy has been updated based on changes in their references.\\n\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef from_project_hierarchy_path(repo_path)\\n\\nfrom_project_hierarchy_path: The function of from_project_hierarchy_path is to parse a JSON representation of a project hierarchy, extract information from the specified repository path, and convert it into a structured MetaInfo object.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- repo_path (str): The path to the repository containing the project_hierarchy.json file.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe from_project_hierarchy_path function first constructs the path to the project_hierarchy.json file within the specified repository path. It then checks the existence of the file and raises an error if it does not exist.\\n\\nSubsequently, the function reads the content of the project_hierarchy.json file, parses it as JSON, and stores it in the project_hierarchy_json variable. It then calls the from_project_hierarchy_json function from MetaInfo to convert the JSON representation into a hierarchical structure represented by a MetaInfo object.\\n\\nThe from_project_hierarchy_json function processes the project_hierarchy_json data by creating DocItem objects to represent directories, files, and their contents.

It retrieves information such as the object\\'s name, type, content, markdown content, and status. If the flash_reference_relation parameter is True, it includes bidirectional reference relations in the JSON output. The function recursively traverses the hierarchy of each file node to capture all nested objects and their details.\\n\\nThe function utilizes the get_full_name method to retrieve the full name of each object in the hierarchy. It populates the JSON structure with relevant metadata for each object, including references to and from other objects if specified. By organizing the metadata in a hierarchical JSON format, it provides a structured overview of the document\\'s content and relationships between objects.\\n\\nNote: Developers can use this function to generate a structured representation of document metadata, including object details and relationships, in a hierarchical JSON format.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n{\\n    \"FileA\": [\\n        {\\n            \"name\": \"ObjectA\",\\n            \"type\": \"TypeA\",\\n            \"md_content\": \"Markdown content here\",\\n            \"item_status\": \"StatusA\",\\n            \"who_reference_me\": [\"ObjectB\"],\\n            \"reference_who\": [\"ObjectC\"],\\n            \"special_reference_type\": \"SpecialType\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"name\": \"ObjectB\",\\n            \"type\": \"TypeB\",\\n            \"md_content\": \"Markdown content here\",\\n            \"item_status\": \"StatusB\",\\n            \"who_reference_me\": [\"ObjectA\"],\\n            \"reference_who\": [\"ObjectC\"],\\n            \"special_reference_type\": \"SpecialType\"\\n        }\\n    ],\\n    \"FileB\": [\\n        {\\n            \"name\": \"ObjectX\",\\n            \"type\": \"TypeX\",\\n            \"md_content\": \"Markdown content here\",\\n            \"item_status\": \"StatusX\",\\n            \"who_reference_me\": [\"ObjectY\"],\\n            \"reference_who\": [\"ObjectZ\"],\\n            \"special_reference_type\": \"SpecialType\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n\\nFunctionDef walk_file(now_obj)\\n\\nwalk_file: The function of walk_file is to recursively traverse a hierarchy of DocItem objects and update the content of each object in a JSON-like format.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_obj: The current DocItem object being processed.\\n\\nThe function then recursively calls walk_file on each child of the current DocItem object.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The to_str function of the DocItemType class is used to convert the item_type of a DocItem object to a string representation.\\n- The flash_reference_relation flag determines whether to include detailed reference information in the JSON object.\\n\\nFunctionDef from_project_hierarchy_json(project_hierarchy_json)\\n\\nfrom_project_hierarchy_json: The function of from_project_hierarchy_json is to parse a JSON representation of a project hierarchy and construct a MetaInfo object that represents the hierarchical structure of the project.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- project_hierarchy_json (dict): A dictionary representing the project hierarchy in JSON format.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe from_project_hierarchy_json function takes in a project_hierarchy_json parameter, which is a dictionary representing the project hierarchy in JSON format. The function initializes a target_meta_info object of type MetaInfo and sets its target_repo_hierarchical_tree attribute to a DocItem object representing the root node of the hierarchical tree.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through each file in the project_hierarchy_json dictionary. For each file, it checks if the file exists and is not empty in the target repository. If the file does not exist or is empty, it logs a message and skips to the next file.\\n\\nNext, the function splits the file path into a list of directories and iterates through each directory in the file path. It checks if the directory already exists as a child of the current node in the hierarchical tree. If the directory does not exist, it creates a new DocItem object representing the directory and adds it as a child of the current node. It then updates the current node to the newly created directory node.\\n\\nAfter processing the directories in the file path, the function creates a new DocItem object representing the file and adds it as a child of the current node.\\n\\nThe function then processes the content of the file. It asserts that the file content is of type list and iterates through each item in the content. For each item, it creates a new DocItem object representing the item and adds it as a child of the file node. It also sets various attributes of the DocItem object based on the item\\'s properties.\\n\\nNext, the function searches for potential parent nodes for each item. It iterates through each item and compares it with other items to determine if there is a parent-child relationship based on the code start and end lines. If a potential parent is found, it assigns the parent to the item and adds the item as a child of the parent node.\\n\\nAfter determining the parent-child relationships, the function calls the change_items function to update the item types based on their content. It checks if the item is a class or function based on the content type and updates the item type accordingly. It also handles special cases where an item is a class function or a sub-function.\\n\\nFinally, the function calls the parse_tree_path function on the root node to parse and update the tree paths for each node in the hierarchical tree. It also calls the check_depth function on the root node to calculate the depth of each node in the tree.\\n\\nThe function returns the target_meta_info object, which represents the hierarchical structure of the project.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The from_project_hierarchy_json function is an essential part of the process to parse the project hierarchy and construct the hierarchical tree structure.\\n- The function assumes that the project_hierarchy_json parameter is a valid JSON representation of the project hierarchy.\\n- The function relies on the MetaInfo, DocItem, DocItemType, and DocItemStatus classes to represent and manipulate the hierarchical structure of the project.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA MetaInfo object representing the hierarchical structure of the project.\\n\\nFunctionDef change_items(now_item)\\n\\nchange_items: The function of change_items is to recursively update the item_type attribute of a DocItem based on the content dictionary values, such as \"ClassDef\" or \"FunctionDef\", and the relationship with its parent item.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_item: Represents the current DocItem object to update.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe change_items function iterates through the children of the current DocItem object and updates the item_type attribute based on specific conditions. If the item_type is not a file, it checks the content type in the dictionary. If the content type is \"ClassDef\", it sets the item_type to _class. If the content type is \"FunctionDef\", it sets the item_type to _function. Additionally, if the current item is a function and its parent is a class, the item_type is set to _class_function. If the parent is a function or a sub-function, the item_type is set to _sub_function.\\n\\nThe function recursively calls itself on each child of the current DocItem object, ensuring that all items in the hierarchy are updated accordingly.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The change_items function is crucial for maintaining the correct item_type hierarchy within the DocItem objects in the project.\\n- It helps in categorizing and identifying different types of objects based on their content and relationship with other items.\\n\\nFunctionDef code_contain(item, other_item)\\n\\ncode_contain: The function of code_contain is to determine if one code item contains another code item within its start and end lines.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- item: Represents a code item with start and end lines.\\n- other_item: Represents another code item to check if it is contained within the first code item.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe code_contain function compares the start and end lines of two code items (item and other_item) to determine if other_item is contained within item. If other_item\\'s end line is less than item\\'s end line or other_item\\'s start line is greater than item\\'s start line, the function returns False, indicating that other_item is not contained within item. Otherwise, it returns True.\\n\\nNote:\\n- This function assumes that the start and end lines of the code items are provided accurately for proper containment checking.\\n- The function does not consider the case where the start and end lines of the two code items are equal, as it returns False in such a scenario.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If item\\'s start line is 5 and end line is 10, and other_item\\'s start line is 7 and end line is 8, the function would return True, indicating that other_item is contained within item.'), Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\reply\\\\RepoAgent\\\\markdown_docs\\\\repo_agent\\\\exceptions.md'}, page_content='ClassDef ErrorHandler\\n\\nErrorHandler: The function of ErrorHandler is to handle different types of exceptions and log appropriate messages based on the type of exception.\\n\\nattributes:\\n- e: The exception object that needs to be handled.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe ErrorHandler class contains a static method called handle_exception, which takes an exception object as a parameter.

This method retrieves all file nodes from the target repository hierarchical tree.\\n\\nNext, the function iterates over each file_item in the file_item_list. For each file_item, it checks if there is any documentation inside the file_item or its children by calling the recursive_check function.\\n\\nThe recursive_check function is defined within the markdown_refresh function. It takes a doc_item as a parameter and recursively checks if there is any documentation inside the doc_item or its children. It returns True if documentation is found, and False otherwise.\\n\\nIf recursive_check returns False for a file_item, it means that there is no documentation inside the file_item or its children. In this case, the function skips the file_item and continues to the next iteration.\\n\\nIf recursive_check returns True for a file_item, it means that there is documentation inside the file_item or its children. The rel_file_path variable is set to the full name of the file_item using the get_full_name method. This represents the relative file path of the file_item within the target repository.\\n\\nThe to_markdown function is defined within the markdown_refresh function. It takes an item and a now_level as parameters and recursively converts the item and its children to markdown format. The function starts by initializing an empty string called markdown_content. It then appends the appropriate markdown headers and content based on the item\\'s properties, such as item_type, obj_name, and md_content. The function also handles the case where the item has parameters by appending them to the markdown_content. It recursively calls itself for each child of the item and appends the returned markdown content. Finally, it returns the markdown_content.\\n\\nThe markdown variable is initialized as an empty string. For each child in the children of the file_item, the to_markdown function is called with the child and a now_level of 2. The returned markdown content is appended to the markdown variable. After iterating over all children, the markdown variable should contain the markdown representation of the file_item and its children.\\n\\nThe assert statement is used to ensure that the markdown variable is not None. If it is None, an AssertionError is raised with the file path of the file_item.\\n\\nThe file_path variable is set to the file path of the markdown file, which is derived from the file_item\\'s file name by replacing the \".py\" extension with \".md\". The abs_file_path variable is set to the target repository path appended with the file_path. The directories leading to the abs_file_path are created if they do not exist using the os.makedirs function. Finally, the markdown content is written to the abs_file_path using the open function.\\n\\nAfter iterating over all file_items, an information message is logged indicating the successful refresh of the markdown documents at the markdown_docs_name location in the project setting.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The markdown_refresh function updates the markdown documents based on the latest document information.\\n- It deletes the existing markdown folder and creates a new one.\\n- It iterates over all file items and checks if there is any documentation inside each file item or its children.\\n- It converts the file items and their children to markdown format using the to_markdown function.\\n- It writes the markdown content to the corresponding markdown files.\\n- The function ensures thread safety by acquiring a lock using the runner_lock attribute.\\n- The function logs an information message indicating the successful refresh of the markdown documents.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf the markdown_refresh function is successful, an information message will be logged indicating the successful refresh of the markdown documents at the specified location.\\n\\nFunctionDef recursive_check(doc_item)\\n\\nrecursive_check: The function of recursive_check is to check if there is a document inside a file.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- doc_item: Represents a DocItem object which contains information about the document.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe recursive_check function takes a doc_item parameter of type DocItem and recursively checks if there is any Markdown content stored in the md_content attribute of the doc_item. If the md_content is not empty, the function returns True. Otherwise, it iterates over the children of the doc_item and recursively calls itself on each child until it finds a document with content or reaches the leaf nodes. If no document content is found in any of the nodes, the function returns False.\\n\\nThis function plays a crucial role in traversing the tree structure of DocItem objects to determine if there is any Markdown content present in any of the nodes or their children.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the doc_item parameter passed to the function is a valid DocItem object.\\n- The function relies on the recursive nature of the tree structure to check for document content effectively.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If the md_content attribute of the doc_item contains Markdown content, the function returns True.\\n- If no Markdown content is found in the doc_item or its children, the function returns False.\\n\\nFunctionDef to_markdown(item, now_level)\\n\\nto_markdown: The function of to_markdown is to generate markdown content based on the provided DocItem object and its children recursively.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- item: Represents a DocItem object containing information about a specific item.\\n- now_level: Indicates the current level of the item in the hierarchy.\\n\\nCode Description: The to_markdown function constructs markdown content by processing the information stored in the DocItem object and its children. It starts by creating a header based on the item\\'s type and name. If the item has parameters, they are included in the header. The function then appends the last content of the item (if available) and recursively processes its children to generate a hierarchical markdown structure. Each child is processed with an increased level indicator to maintain the hierarchy. A horizontal rule is added after each child\\'s content.\\n\\nThe function utilizes the to_str method from the DocItemType class to convert the item\\'s type to a string representation. This conversion helps in including the type information in the generated markdown content.\\n\\nNote: It is crucial to ensure that the DocItemType values are correctly defined to match the expected types in the to_str function. Any additional DocItemType values added in the future should be handled to prevent unexpected behavior.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\n```\\n\\nClassDef ExampleClass\\n\\nClass documentation content...\\n\\nFunctionDef example_function(param1, param2)\\n\\nFunction documentation content...\\n\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef git_commit(self, commit_message)\\n\\ngit_commit: The function of git_commit is to commit changes to a Git repository with a specified commit message.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- commit_message: A string representing the message for the commit.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe git_commit function utilizes the subprocess module to execute a Git commit command with the provided commit message.

It takes two parameters: file_handler, which is an object that handles file operations such as reading and writing, and json_data, which is a dictionary that stores the project structure information.\\n\\nWithin the function, a file_dict is created to store the objects within the file. The function iterates through the objects in the file using the get_functions_and_classes method of the file_handler object. For each object, it retrieves the code information using the get_obj_code_info method of the file_handler object. It then generates documentation for the code using the generate_doc method of the chat_engine object. The generated documentation is stored in the md_content field of the code_info dictionary.\\n\\nThe file_dict is updated with the code_info dictionary, using the name of the object as the key. The json_data dictionary is updated with the file_dict, using the file_handler.file_path as the key. The updated json_data is then written back to the JSON file.\\n\\nNext, the function converts the updated json_data into markdown format using the convert_to_markdown_file method of the file_handler object. The markdown content is then written to a .md file using the write_file method of the file_handler object.\\n\\nFinally, the function logs the completion of the process by outputting the file path and the corresponding actions taken.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the file_handler object is properly initialized with the correct repo_path and file_path.\\n- The function relies on the file_handler object to read and write files, as well as retrieve code information and convert it to markdown format.\\n- The json_data dictionary should contain the necessary project structure information before calling this function.\\n- The function updates the json_data and writes it back to the JSON file, as well as generates and writes the markdown documentation for the new projects.\\n- It is important to note that the function relies on the chat_engine object to generate the documentation for the code objects. Ensure that the chat_engine object is properly initialized and configured before calling this function.\\n\\nFunctionDef process_file_changes(self, repo_path, file_path, is_new_file)\\n\\nprocess_file_changes: The function of process_file_changes is to process changed files according to the absolute file path, including new files and existing files. It takes the repo_path, file_path, and is_new_file as input parameters. The repo_path is the path to the repository, file_path is the relative path to the file, and is_new_file indicates whether the file is new or not.\\n\\nThe function begins by creating a FileHandler object, file_handler, to handle file operations for the changed file. It then reads the content of the file using the read_file method of the file_handler.\\n\\nNext, the function uses the change_detector object to parse the differences in the file using the parse_diffs method. It retrieves the changed lines and identifies the changes in the file structure using the identify_changes_in_structure method. The changes in the file structure are stored in the changes_in_pyfile dictionary.\\n\\nThe function then checks if the file exists in the project_hierarchy.json file. If it does, it updates the JSON file with the changes in the file structure and writes the updated file back to the JSON file. It also converts the changes in the file structure to markdown format using the convert_to_markdown_file method of the file_handler and writes the markdown content to a .md file.\\n\\nIf the file does not exist in the project_hierarchy.json file, the function adds a new item to the JSON file using the add_new_item method of the Runner class.\\n\\nFinally, the function adds the modified Markdown files to the staging area using the add_unstaged_files method of the change_detector object.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the repo_path and file_path parameters are correctly provided.\\n- The function relies on the FileHandler, change_detector, and project_manager objects to perform file operations, parse differences, and manage the project hierarchy.\\n- The function updates the project hierarchy JSON file and generates Markdown documentation for the changed files.\\n- Handle exceptions related to file operations and subprocess calls appropriately.\\n\\nFunctionDef update_existing_item(self, file_dict, file_handler, changes_in_pyfile)\\n\\nupdate_existing_item: The function of update_existing_item is to update the existing projects by making changes to the file structure information dictionary based on the provided file dictionary, file handler, and changes in the Python file.\\n\\nParameters:\\n- file_dict (dict): A dictionary containing the file structure information.\\n- file_handler (FileHandler): The file handler object used to access file-related operations.\\n- changes_in_pyfile (dict): A dictionary containing information about the objects that have changed in the Python file.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe update_existing_item function is responsible for updating the existing projects by making changes to the file structure information dictionary. It takes three parameters: file_dict, file_handler, and changes_in_pyfile.\\n\\nFirst, the function calls the get_new_objects function to retrieve the new and deleted objects based on the provided file handler. The new objects are stored in the new_obj variable, and the deleted objects are stored in the del_obj variable.\\n\\nNext, the function iterates through the deleted objects and removes them from the file_dict if they exist. It also logs a message indicating that the object has been deleted.\\n\\nThen, the function generates the current file structure information by calling the generate_file_structure function of the file_handler object. It retrieves the current objects and stores them in the current_objects variable.\\n\\nThe function creates a dictionary called current_info_dict to store the current object information using the object name as the key and the object information as the value.\\n\\nNext, the function updates the global file structure information in the file_dict by iterating through the current object information. If the current object exists in the file_dict, its information is updated with the corresponding information from the current_info_dict. If the current object does not exist in the file_dict, it is added to the file_dict.\\n\\nThen, the function iterates through the added objects in the changes_in_pyfile and retrieves the referencer list for each object by calling the find_all_referencer function of the project_manager object. The object name and its referencer list are stored in the referencer_list.\\n\\nThe function uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to concurrently update the objects in the changes_in_pyfile. For each added object, it retrieves the corresponding referencer list from the referencer_list and submits a task to the executor to update the object by calling the update_object function.\\n\\nFinally, the function returns the updated file_dict.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The file_dict parameter should be a dictionary containing the file structure information.\\n- The file_handler parameter should be a valid FileHandler object.\\n- The changes_in_pyfile parameter should be a dictionary containing information about the objects that have changed in the Python file.\\n- The get_new_objects function is called to retrieve the new and deleted objects.\\n- The generate_file_structure function is called to generate the current file structure information.\\n- The find_all_referencer function is called to retrieve the referencer list for each added object.\\n- The update_object function is called to update each added object.\\n- The function uses a ThreadPoolExecutor to improve performance by executing tasks concurrently.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n{\\n    \"function_name\": {\\n        \"type\": \"function\",\\n        \"code_start_line\": 10,\\n        \"code_end_line\": 20,\\n        \"parent\": \"class_name\",\\n        \"name_column\": 5\\n    },\\n    \"class_name\": {\\n        \"type\": \"class\",\\n        \"code_start_line\": 5,\\n        \"code_end_line\": 25,\\n        \"parent\": None,\\n        \"name_column\": 10\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nFunctionDef update_object(self, file_dict, file_handler, obj_name, obj_referencer_list)\\n\\nupdate_object: The function of update_object is to generate documentation content and update the corresponding field information of the object.\\n\\nParameters:\\n- file_dict (dict): A dictionary containing old object information.\\n- file_handler: The file handler.\\n- obj_name (str): The object name.\\n- obj_referencer_list (list): The list of object referencers.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe update_object function is responsible for generating documentation content and updating the corresponding field information of the object.

It does not require any input parameters and serves as a basic demonstration of printing messages.\\n\\nNote: This function is straightforward and does not have any specific use case other than demonstrating the printing functionality.\\n\\nClassDef ChangeDetector\\n\\nChangeDetector: The ChangeDetector class is responsible for handling file differences and change detection. It utilizes the FileHandler class to access the file system. The core functionality of the ChangeDetector class is to identify changes in files since the last commit.\\n\\nAttributes:\\n- repo_path (str): The path to the repository.\\n- repo (git.Repo): The Git repository object.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe ChangeDetector class provides several methods to track and analyze changes in files within a Git repository.\\n\\nThe __init__ method initializes a ChangeDetector object by setting the repo_path attribute and creating a git.Repo object for the specified repository path.\\n\\nThe get_staged_pys method retrieves the added Python files in the repository that have been staged. It uses the GitPython library to compare the staging area (index) with the original HEAD commit. The method returns a dictionary of changed Python files, where the keys are the file paths and the values are booleans indicating whether the file is newly created or not.\\n\\nThe get_file_diff method retrieves the changes made to a specific file. For new files, it adds them to the staging area and then gets the diff from the staging area. For non-new files, it gets the diff from HEAD. The method returns a list of changes made to the file.\\n\\nThe parse_diffs method parses the difference content obtained from the get_file_diff method. It extracts the added and deleted object information, which can be a class or a function. The method returns a dictionary containing the added and deleted line information.\\n\\nThe identify_changes_in_structure method identifies the structure (function or class) where changes have occurred. It traverses all changed lines and checks whether each line falls within the start and end line numbers of a structure. If a line is within a structure, the structure is considered to have changed, and its name and the name of the parent structure are added to the corresponding set in the result dictionary. The method returns a dictionary containing the structures where changes have occurred.\\n\\nThe get_to_be_staged_files method retrieves all unstaged files in the repository that meet certain conditions.

It then detects staged changes by utilizing the GitPython library to compare the staging area with the original HEAD commit. By iterating through the detected differences, the function identifies added or modified Python files that end with the \".py\" extension. The function constructs a dictionary where the keys represent the file paths, and the values indicate whether the file is newly created or not based on the change type.\\n\\nIn the project, this function is called within the TestChangeDetector class to test the functionality of identifying staged Python files. The test scenario involves creating a new Python file, staging it, initializing a ChangeDetector object with the repository path, and then verifying that the newly created file is present in the list of staged files.\\n\\nNote: \\nIt is crucial to note that the logic of the GitPython library differs from the standard Git behavior, particularly in handling new files in the staging area.

The function then returns a dictionary containing the added and removed line information.\\n\\nWhen called within the project, the parse_diffs function is utilized in the process_file_changes method of the Runner class. In this context, parse_diffs is used to identify changes in structure within Python files, update corresponding JSON files, convert content to Markdown, and manage version control operations.\\n\\nNote: \\n- The parse_diffs function is dependent on the get_file_diff() method to obtain the difference content.\\n- The function distinguishes between added and removed lines based on specific prefixes in the differences.\\n- It is crucial to ensure the correct input format (list of differences) when calling the parse_diffs function.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n{\\'added\\': [(86, \\'    \\'), (87, \\'    def to_json_new(self, comments = True):\\'), (88, \\'        data = {\\'), (89, \\'            \"name\": self.node_name,\\')...(95, \\'\\')], \\'removed\\': []}\\n\\nFunctionDef identify_changes_in_structure(self, changed_lines, structures)\\n\\nidentify_changes_in_structure: The function of identify_changes_in_structure is to identify the structures (functions or classes) where changes have occurred based on the provided changed lines and structures list.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- changed_lines (dict): A dictionary containing the line numbers where changes have occurred, with keys \\'added\\' and \\'removed\\'.\\n- structures (list): A list of function or class structures containing structure type, name, start line number, end line number, and parent structure name.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe function iterates through the changed lines and structures to determine if a line falls within a structure\\'s start and end lines. If a line is within a structure, the function adds the structure\\'s name and parent structure\\'s name to the result dictionary based on whether the line was added or removed.\\n\\nIn the calling object process_file_changes in runner.py, this function is used to identify changes in the structure of a file by parsing the differences in the file, extracting functions and classes, and updating the project hierarchy information accordingly. The identified changes are logged, and if the file is found in the project hierarchy, its information is updated and written back to the JSON file. Additionally, a Markdown file is created based on the updated information. If the file is not found, a new item is added to the project hierarchy.\\n\\nNote: \\n- Ensure that the changed_lines and structures parameters are correctly formatted as described in the function documentation.\\n- The function assumes that the structures list is obtained from get_functions_and_classes method.\\n- The output dictionary contains sets of structure names and parent structure names for added and removed changes.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\n{\\'added\\': {(\\'PipelineAutoMatNode\\', None), (\\'to_json_new\\', \\'PipelineAutoMatNode\\')}, \\'removed\\': set()}\\n\\nFunctionDef get_to_be_staged_files(self)\\n\\nget_to_be_staged_files: The function of get_to_be_staged_files is to retrieve all unstaged files in the repository that meet specific conditions and return a list of their paths.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- None\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_to_be_staged_files function first retrieves the already staged files in the repository. It then identifies unstaged files based on two conditions: files whose extension changes to .md correspond to staged files, and files whose path matches the \\'project_hierarchy\\' field in the configuration. The function processes untracked files and unstaged files separately, checking if they meet the specified conditions for inclusion in the list of files to be staged. Finally, it returns a list of relative file paths that are either modified but not staged or untracked and meet the defined conditions.\\n\\nIn the project, this function is called by the add_unstaged_files method in the ChangeDetector class.

It takes two parameters, shorten_attempt and prompt_data. The method first logs the attempt number to reduce the length of the messages. If it is the first attempt, it removes the project_structure and project_structure_prefix from the prompt_data. If it is the second attempt, it further removes the caller and callee (reference) information from the prompt_data. Finally, it updates the sys_prompt with the modified prompt_data and returns it.\\n\\nThe generate_response method generates a response message using the OpenAI API. It takes four parameters: model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, and max_tokens. It creates a list of messages containing the system prompt and user prompt. It then sends a request to the OpenAI API to generate a completion based on the model, messages, temperature, and max tokens. The response message is extracted from the API response and returned.\\n\\nThe attempt_generate_response method attempts to generate a response message using the generate_response method. It takes five parameters: model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, max_tokens, and max_attempts. It tries to generate a response message using the generate_response method. If the response message is None, it retries the request after a delay. If there is a connection error, it logs the error and retries after a delay. If there is an unknown error, it logs the error and retries after a longer delay. After a maximum number of attempts, it raises an exception or returns a default response message.\\n\\nThe generate_doc method generates the documentation for a given doc_item. It takes two parameters: doc_item and file_handler. It extracts the code information from the doc_item and determines if the code is referenced by other objects.

It is responsible for attempting to generate a response by calling the generate_response function multiple times in case of errors.\\n\\nThe function starts by initializing the attempt variable to 0. It then enters a while loop that continues until the attempt variable reaches the max_attempts value.\\n\\nWithin the loop, the function calls the generate_response function with the provided model, sys_prompt, usr_prompt, and max_tokens parameters. The response message is stored in the response_message variable.\\n\\nIf the response_message is None, indicating an unsuccessful response generation, the attempt variable is incremented by 1 and the loop continues to the next iteration.\\n\\nIf the response_message is not None, indicating a successful response generation, the function immediately returns the response_message.\\n\\nIf an APIConnectionError exception is raised during the generate_response function call, the error is logged using the logger.error method. The error message includes the specific error and the current attempt number out of the maximum attempts. The function then waits for 7 seconds using the time.sleep method and increments the attempt variable by 1. If the attempt variable reaches the max_attempts value, the exception is raised. Otherwise, the loop continues to the next iteration.\\n\\nIf any other exception is raised during the generate_response function call, the error is logged using the logger.error method. The error message includes the specific error and the current attempt number out of the maximum attempts. The function then waits for 10 seconds using the time.sleep method and increments the attempt variable by 1. If the attempt variable reaches the max_attempts value, a predefined response message is created using the ResponseMessage class with an error message indicating an unknown error occurred while generating the documentation. The function returns this response message.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Developers should ensure the correct API key, base URL, and timeout settings are provided for successful interaction with the OpenAI API.\\n- Proper exception handling and retry mechanisms should be implemented to improve the robustness of response generation.\\n- The max_attempts parameter can be adjusted to control the number of attempts made to generate a response.\\n- The attempt_generate_response function is called within the project\\'s ChatEngine class to handle response generation attempts.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n\"A generated response message based on the provided prompts and model.\"\\n\\nFunctionDef generate_doc(self, doc_item, file_handler)\\n\\ngenerate_doc: The function of generate_doc is to generate documentation for a given object. It takes a DocItem object, which contains information about the code, and a file_handler object, which provides access to the project\\'s files. The function retrieves the necessary information from the DocItem object, such as the code type, name, content, and whether it has a return value. It also checks if the code is referenced by other objects or if it references other objects.\\n\\nThe function then uses the ProjectManager instance to build the hierarchical structure of the project, including the object\\'s position in the structure. It also retrieves information about the objects that reference the code and the objects that are referenced by the code.\\n\\nNext, the function prepares prompts for the OpenAI chat model by combining the relevant information, such as the code type, name, content, and references. It also handles cases where the total number of tokens in the prompts exceeds the model\\'s limit by either trying a larger model or reducing the input length.\\n\\nOnce the prompts are prepared, the function sends a request to the chat model to generate the documentation. It handles potential errors, such as API connection errors, by logging the errors, waiting for a specified time, and retrying the request. If the maximum number of attempts is reached without a successful response, the function either raises an exception or returns a predefined response message.\\n\\nThe generated documentation is then returned as a response message. If the code is referenced by other objects, the function includes information about the objects that reference it and their corresponding code and documentation. Similarly, if the code references other objects, the function includes information about the objects that are referenced and their corresponding code and documentation. The function also provides a possible appearance of the code\\'s return value as an output example.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the generate_doc function relies on the ChatEngine class and the ResponseMessage class to handle the generation of the documentation and the storage of response messages, respectively.\\n\\nDevelopers can utilize the generate_doc function to automatically generate documentation for code objects in their projects. By providing the necessary information and utilizing the OpenAI chat model, the function can generate detailed and accurate documentation, including information about references and return values.\\n\\nNote: The generate_doc function may encounter limitations in processing code that exceeds the model\\'s token limit. In such cases, the function attempts to use larger models or reduce the input length to generate the documentation. However, if the code itself is too long to process, the function returns a predefined response message indicating the limitation.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_referenced_prompt(doc_item)\\n\\nget_referenced_prompt: The function of get_referenced_prompt is to generate a prompt detailing the objects referenced by a given DocItem, including their code snippets and documentation.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- doc_item: A DocItem object representing the item for which the referenced prompt is generated.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_referenced_prompt function iterates through the referenced objects of the input DocItem and constructs a prompt for each referenced object. It includes the object\\'s full name, documentation content, and raw code snippet. The function appends each prompt to a list and returns the concatenated prompts as a single string.\\n\\nThe function first checks if there are any referenced objects. If there are, it constructs a prompt for each referenced object by extracting the object\\'s full name, documentation content (if available), and raw code snippet. The prompt is formatted with the object\\'s full name, followed by the documentation content (or \\'None\\' if not available), and the raw code snippet enclosed in triple backticks.\\n\\nThe prompts for all referenced objects are collected in a list, and the function joins these prompts with newline characters to create the final prompt string, which is then returned.\\n\\nNote: \\n- This function provides a structured overview of the objects referenced by a given DocItem, aiding in understanding the relationships between different elements in the project.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nAs you can see, the code calls the following objects, their code and docs are as following:\\nobj: repo_agent\\\\doc_meta_info.py/DocItem\\nDocument: \\nAn unknown error occurred while generating this documentation after many tries.\\nRaw code:\\n```\\nclass DocItem:\\n    item_type: DocItemType = DocItemType._class_function\\n    item_status: DocItemStatus = DocItemStatus.doc_has_not_been_generated\\n\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef get_referencer_prompt(doc_item)\\n\\nget_referencer_prompt: The function of get_referencer_prompt is to generate a prompt detailing the objects that reference a given DocItem object, including their code snippets and documentation.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- doc_item: A DocItem object for which the referencing objects prompt is generated.\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe get_referencer_prompt function constructs a prompt that lists the objects referencing a specific DocItem object. It first checks if there are any referencing objects. If there are, it iterates through each referencing object and creates a formatted prompt for each.\\n\\nFor each referencing object, the function includes the object\\'s name, documentation, and code snippet in the prompt. If the referencing object has documentation available, it includes the last entry from the documentation. If the referencing object has code content available, it includes the code snippet.\\n\\nThe function then joins all the individual prompts into a single formatted string and returns it as the final prompt.\\n\\nNote: \\n- The function returns an empty string if there are no referencing objects for the given DocItem.\\n- The prompt generated provides insights into the objects that reference the input DocItem, aiding in understanding the relationships within the codebase.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\nAlso, the code has been called by the following objects, their code and docs are as following:\\nobj: repo_agent\\\\doc_meta_info.py/DocItem\\nDocument: An unknown error occurred while generating this documentation after many tries.\\nRaw code:\\n```python\\nclass DocItem:\\n    item_type: DocItemType = DocItemType._class_function\\n    item_status: DocItemStatus = DocItemStatus.doc_has_not_been_generated\\n\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef get_relationship_description(referencer_content, reference_letter)\\n\\nget_relationship_description: The function of get_relationship_description is to provide a description of the relationship between referencer content and reference letter in a project from a functional perspective.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- referencer_content: Represents the content of the referencer.\\n- reference_letter: Represents the reference letter associated with the referencer.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe function first checks if both referencer_content and reference_letter are present.

If not provided, it defaults to None.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe read_config function first checks if a file_path is provided. If not, it calls the get_config_path function to determine the configuration file path. It then opens the configuration file, reads its contents using the tomli library, and returns the configuration data as a dictionary. In case of any decoding errors, an empty dictionary is returned.\\n\\nRelationship with Callers:\\nThe read_config function is typically called by other parts of the application that require access to configuration settings. It relies on the get_config_path function to obtain the correct path to the configuration file before reading its contents.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The read_config function can handle both cases where a file_path is provided and where it is not, ensuring flexibility in configuration file retrieval.\\n- It is important to handle any potential decoding errors that may occur when reading the configuration file.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf the configuration file contains the following data:\\npython\\n{\\n    \"key1\": \"value1\",\\n    \"key2\": 123,\\n    \"key3\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\\n}\\nThe read_config function will return:\\npython\\n{\\n    \"key1\": \"value1\",\\n    \"key2\": 123,\\n    \"key3\": [\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"]\\n}\\n\\nFunctionDef write_config(update_config, file_path)\\n\\nwrite_config: The function of write_config is to update the existing configuration with new key-value pairs and write the updated configuration back to a file.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- update_config: A dictionary containing the new key-value pairs to be added or updated in the configuration.\\n- file_path: An optional parameter representing the path to the configuration file.

It then reads the existing configuration from the file, updates it with the new key-value pairs from update_config, and writes the modified configuration back to the file in TOML format.\\n\\nThe function ensures that the configuration file is loaded correctly and handles cases where the file might not exist or is empty. By updating the existing configuration with the new values, it allows for dynamic changes to the application\\'s settings without losing previous configurations.\\n\\nRelationship with Callers:\\nThe write_config function is called by other parts of the project, such as the configure function in main.py, where it is used to save project and chat completion settings to the configuration file.

Each type represents a specific level of granularity, allowing for better organization and understanding of the project\\'s structure.\\n\\nThe class provides two methods: to_str() and print_self(). The to_str() method returns a string representation of the DocItemType, mapping the enum values to their corresponding string names. The print_self() method returns a colored string representation of the DocItemType, which is useful for printing the object type in a visually distinguishable manner.\\n\\nThe class also defines a get_edge_type() method, which is currently empty and does not have any implementation. This method is intended to determine the type of edge between two DocItemTypes, but its functionality is not yet implemented.\\n\\nThe DocItemType class is used throughout the project to categorize and identify different types of objects. It is primarily used in the DocItem class, where each DocItem object is assigned a specific DocItemType based on its role in the project hierarchy.\\n\\nNote: \\n- The to_str() method is used to convert the DocItemType enum values to their string representations, which can be useful for display purposes.\\n- The print_self() method is used to print the DocItemType with colored formatting, making it easier to visually distinguish different types of objects.\\n- The get_edge_type() method is currently empty and does not have any functionality implemented.

If none of these types match, it returns the name of the instance.\\n\\nThis function is called in different parts of the project to convert the DocItemType to a string representation for various purposes. For example, in the walk_file function in MetaInfo, the to_str function is used to set the type field in a JSON object. Similarly, in the to_markdown function in Runner, the to_str function is used to include the type of the item in the generated markdown content.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the DocItemType values are correctly defined to match the expected types in the to_str function.\\n- Handle any additional DocItemType values that may be added in the future to avoid unexpected behavior.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If self is of type _class, the function will return \"ClassDef\".\\n- If self is of type _function, _class_function, or _sub_function, the function will return \"FunctionDef\".\\n- If self is of a different type, the function will return the name of the instance.\\n\\nFunctionDef print_self(self)\\n\\nprint_self: The function of print_self is to determine the color based on the type of the DocItemType and return the formatted string including the name of the DocItemType.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- self: The current instance of the class.\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe print_self function in the DocItemType class determines the color based on the type of DocItemType. It assigns a specific color to different types of DocItemType such as directory, file, class, function, sub-function, and class function. The function then returns the formatted string including the name of the DocItemType with the assigned color.\\n\\nIn the calling situation, the print_self function is utilized within the print_recursive function of the DocItem class. It is used to print the type of the item along with its name, and in case of a specified condition, the item status as well. This function helps in recursively printing the repository objects with proper indentation and formatting.\\n\\nNote: \\nDevelopers can use this function to display different types of DocItemType with distinct colors for better visualization and understanding.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\nIf the DocItemType is a directory, the output may look like: \"\\\\x1b[32m_dir\\\\x1b[0m: directory_name\"\\n\\nFunctionDef get_edge_type(self, from_item_type, to_item_type)\\n\\nget_edge_type: The function of get_edge_type is to retrieve the edge type between two specified item types.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- from_item_type: Represents the source item type for which the edge type needs to be determined.\\n- to_item_type: Represents the target item type for which the edge type needs to be determined.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_edge_type function takes two parameters, from_item_type and to_item_type, both of type DocItemType.

It provides a set of predefined status values that can be used to determine the state of a documentation item.\\n\\nThe DocItemStatus class is defined using the Enum class from the enum module. It has five attributes: doc_up_to_date, doc_has_not_been_generated, code_changed, add_new_referencer, and referencer_not_exist. Each attribute represents a specific status of a documentation item.\\n\\nThe doc_up_to_date attribute indicates that the documentation is up to date and does not need to be generated. The doc_has_not_been_generated attribute indicates that the documentation has not been generated yet and needs to be generated. The code_changed attribute indicates that the source code has been modified and the documentation needs to be updated. The add_new_referencer attribute indicates that a new object has referenced the documentation item. The referencer_not_exist attribute indicates that an object that previously referenced the documentation item has been deleted or no longer references it.\\n\\nThese attributes are defined using the auto() function from the enum module, which automatically assigns unique values to each attribute.\\n\\nThe DocItemStatus class is used in the project to determine the status of a documentation item and decide whether the documentation needs to be generated or updated. It is used in the need_to_generate function in the repo_agent\\\\doc_meta_info.py/need_to_generate module to check the status of a documentation item and determine whether it needs to be generated based on its status and other conditions.\\n\\nThe DocItemStatus class is also used in other parts of the project, such as the MetaInfo class in the repo_agent\\\\doc_meta_info.py/MetaInfo module, to handle the status of documentation items during the generation process.\\n\\nNote: The DocItemStatus class provides a convenient way to represent the status of a documentation item and determine whether it needs to be generated or updated based on its status. It is an essential component of the documentation generation process in the project.\\n\\nFunctionDef need_to_generate(doc_item, ignore_list)\\n\\nneed_to_generate: The function of need_to_generate is to determine whether a documentation item needs to be generated based on its status and other conditions.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- doc_item: A DocItem object representing the documentation item to be checked.\\n- ignore_list (optional): A list of file paths to be ignored. The default value is an empty list.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe need_to_generate function takes a DocItem object and an optional ignore_list as input parameters. It first checks the status of the doc_item. If the item_status attribute of the doc_item is DocItemStatus.doc_up_to_date, indicating that the documentation is already up to date, the function returns False.\\n\\nNext, the function retrieves the relative file path of the doc_item using the get_full_name method. If the item_type attribute of the doc_item is one of [DocItemType._file, DocItemType._dir, DocItemType._repo], which represents file or higher granularity levels, the function returns False. This means that the function does not generate documentation for files or higher-level objects.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through the parent objects of the doc_item using a while loop. It checks if the current parent object is a file (DocItemType._file). If it is, the function checks if the relative file path starts with any item in the ignore_list. If it does, indicating that the current file is in the ignore_list or under a path in the ignore_list, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.\\n\\nIf the while loop completes without finding a file parent object, the function returns False.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The need_to_generate function is used to determine whether a documentation item needs to be generated based on its status and other conditions.\\n- It checks the status of the item and skips generation if the item is already up to date.\\n- It skips generation for file or higher-level objects.\\n- It checks if the current file is in the ignore_list or under a path in the ignore_list and skips generation if it is.\\n- The ignore_list parameter is optional and can be used to specify file paths to be ignored during generation.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If doc_item.item_status is DocItemStatus.doc_up_to_date: False\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._file: False\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._dir: False\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._repo: False\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._class and rel_file_path is not in ignore_list: True\\n- If doc_item.item_type is DocItemType._class and rel_file_path is in ignore_list: False\\n\\nClassDef DocItem\\n\\nAn unknown error occurred while generating this documentation after many tries.\\n\\nFunctionDef has_ans_relation(now_a, now_b)\\n\\nhas_ans_relation: The function of has_ans_relation is to check if there is an ancestor relationship between two nodes and return the earlier node if it exists.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_a (DocItem): The first node.\\n- now_b (DocItem): The second node.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe has_ans_relation function takes two DocItem objects as input, representing nodes in a tree structure. It checks if there is an ancestor relationship between the two nodes by examining their tree paths. If an ancestor relationship exists, the function returns the earlier node; otherwise, it returns None.\\n\\nIn the project, this function is called within the walk_file function of the MetaInfo class in the doc_meta_info.py file. Specifically, it is used to determine if there is an ancestor relationship between two nodes representing objects in a codebase. If such a relationship is not found, the function updates the references between the nodes accordingly.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the input parameters are valid DocItem objects representing nodes in a tree structure.\\n- The function only considers direct ancestor relationships between nodes.\\n- If no ancestor relationship is found, the function returns None.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n```python\\n\\nExample usage of has_ans_relation function\\n\\nnode_a = DocItem()\\nnode_b = DocItem()\\n\\nAssuming node_a is an ancestor of node_b\\n\\nresult = has_ans_relation(node_a, node_b)\\nprint(result)  # Output: node_a\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef get_travel_list(self)\\n\\nget_travel_list: The function of get_travel_list is to traverse the tree structure in a pre-order manner, with the root node being the first element in the resulting list.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- None\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe get_travel_list function recursively traverses the tree structure starting from the current node in a pre-order manner. It appends each node to the now_list, which is initially a list containing only the current node. The function then iterates over the children of the current node, recursively calls get_travel_list on each child, and concatenates the resulting lists to the now_list. Finally, it returns the now_list containing all nodes in the pre-order traversal sequence.\\n\\nIn the calling context of the project, the get_travel_list function is utilized within the get_task_manager method of the MetaInfo class. It is used to retrieve a list of DocItem nodes based on certain criteria specified by the task_available_func and white_list attributes of the MetaInfo instance. The retrieved list is further processed to create a task manager that manages tasks based on the dependencies between the DocItem nodes.\\n\\nNote: \\n- The get_travel_list function assumes a tree-like structure where each node has children.\\n- Ensure that the tree structure does not contain circular references to prevent potential issues during traversal.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\n[Node1, Node2, Node3, ...]\\n\\nFunctionDef check_depth(self)\\n\\ncheck_depth: The function of check_depth is to recursively calculate the depth of a node in a tree.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- No parameters are passed explicitly to this function. It operates on the object itself.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe check_depth function recursively determines the depth of a node in a tree structure. It first checks if the node has any children. If it does not have any children, the depth of the node is set to 0 and returned. If the node has children, it iterates through each child, recursively calling the check_depth function on each child to find the maximum depth among the children. Finally, the depth of the current node is set to the maximum child depth plus 1, representing the depth of the current node in the tree.\\n\\nIn the project, the check_depth function is called on the target repository hierarchical tree after constructing the tree from a JSON representation of the project hierarchy. This function call is part of the process to parse the tree structure and calculate the depth of each node in the tree.\\n\\nNote:\\nEnsure that the tree structure is properly constructed before calling check_depth to accurately calculate the depth of each node.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf the depth of a node in the tree is calculated to be 3, the function will return 3.\\n\\nFunctionDef parse_tree_path(self, now_path)\\n\\nparse_tree_path: The function of parse_tree_path is to recursively parse the tree path by appending the current node to the given path.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_path (list): The current path in the tree.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe parse_tree_path function takes a list now_path representing the current path in the tree. It appends the current node to the given path by setting self.tree_path to now_path concatenated with the current node. Then, it iterates through the children of the current node, calling parse_tree_path recursively on each child with the updated tree path.\\n\\nIn the project, this function is called within the from_project_hierarchy_json function in the MetaInfo class. After constructing the hierarchical tree structure based on the project hierarchy JSON, the parse_tree_path function is invoked on the root node of the tree to parse and update the tree paths for each node in the hierarchy. This step ensures that each node\\'s path accurately reflects its position within the tree structure.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The parse_tree_path function plays a crucial role in establishing the correct tree paths for nodes in the hierarchical structure, aiding in subsequent operations that rely on accurate path information.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_file_name(self)\\n\\nget_file_name: The function of get_file_name is to retrieve the file name of an object.\\n\\nparameters: This function does not take any parameters.\\n\\nCode Description: The get_file_name function is a method of the DocItem class. It is used to obtain the file name of an object by calling the get_full_name method and manipulating the returned value.\\n\\nThe function first calls the get_full_name method to retrieve the full name of the object, including all the names of its parent objects in a hierarchical manner. It then splits the full name using the \".py\" extension as the delimiter, and takes the first part of the split result. Finally, it concatenates the first part with the \".py\" extension to form the file name of the object.\\n\\nThe purpose of this function is to provide a convenient way to obtain the file name of an object without the need to manually manipulate the full name string.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\nIf the full name of the object is \"repo_agent/doc_meta_info.py/DocItem/get_file_name\", the function will return \"repo_agent/doc_meta_info.py\".\\n\\nFunctionDef get_full_name(self, strict)\\n\\nget_full_name: The function of get_full_name is to retrieve the full name of an object, including all the names of its parent objects in a hierarchical manner.\\n\\nparameters: \\n- strict (optional): A boolean value indicating whether to include the names of objects with name duplicates. The default value is False.\\n\\nCode Description: \\nThe get_full_name function is used to obtain the full name of an object by traversing from the current object to its parent objects. The function starts by checking if the current object has a parent. If it does not have a parent, it returns the object\\'s own name. Otherwise, it creates an empty list to store the names of the objects in the hierarchy.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through each object in the hierarchy, starting from the current object and moving up to its parent objects. For each object, it retrieves the object\\'s name and checks if the strict parameter is set to True. If strict is True, it checks if there are any other objects with the same name in the parent object\\'s children. If there is a duplicate name, it appends \"(name_duplicate_version)\" to the object\\'s name.\\n\\nThe function adds the object\\'s name to the name_list and updates the current object to its parent object. This process continues until there are no more parent objects.\\n\\nFinally, the function removes the first element from the name_list (which is the current object\\'s name) and joins the remaining names with a forward slash (\"/\") to create the full name of the object. The function returns the full name as a string.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\nIf the object hierarchy is as follows:\\n- Object A\\n  - Object B\\n    - Object C\\n\\nCalling get_full_name on Object C would return \"A/B/C\".\\n\\nNote: \\n- The strict parameter is optional and defaults to False. When set to True, it includes the names of objects with name duplicates in the full name.\\n\\nFunctionDef find(self, recursive_file_path)\\n\\nfind: The function of find is to search for a specific file in the repository hierarchy based on a given list of file paths.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- recursive_file_path (list): The list of file paths to search for.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe find function is a method of the DocItem class. It is used to search for a specific file in the repository hierarchy based on a given list of file paths. The function takes in a parameter recursive_file_path, which is a list of file paths representing the path to the desired file.\\n\\nThe function starts by asserting that the item_type of the current DocItem object is equal to DocItemType._repo, which represents the root node of the documentation hierarchy. This ensures that the function is called on the correct type of object.\\n\\nNext, the function initializes a variable pos to 0 and a variable now to the current DocItem object. These variables will be used to keep track of the current position in the recursive_file_path list and the current DocItem object in the hierarchy.\\n\\nThe function then enters a while loop that iterates until pos is less than the length of the recursive_file_path list. Inside the loop, the function checks if the current file path at index pos exists as a key in the children dictionary of the current DocItem object. If the file path does not exist, the function returns None, indicating that the file was not found in the hierarchy. If the file path does exist, the function updates the now variable to the corresponding child DocItem object and increments pos by 1.\\n\\nOnce the while loop completes, the function returns the final value of now, which represents the DocItem object corresponding to the desired file.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The function assumes that the item_type of the current DocItem object is DocItemType._repo. If this is not the case, an assertion error will be raised.\\n- The function expects the recursive_file_path parameter to be a list of file paths. If a different type of input is provided, the behavior of the function may be unpredictable.\\n- If the file is not found in the hierarchy, the function returns None.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If the file is found in the hierarchy, the function returns the corresponding DocItem object.\\n- If the file is not found in the hierarchy, the function returns None.\\n\\nFunctionDef check_has_task(now_item, ignore_list)\\n\\ncheck_has_task: The function of check_has_task is to recursively check if a documentation item or its children require task generation based on certain conditions.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_item: A DocItem object representing the current documentation item to be checked.\\n- ignore_list (optional): A list of file paths to be ignored during the task generation process. The default value is an empty list.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe check_has_task function takes a DocItem object and an optional ignore_list as input parameters. It first calls the need_to_generate function to determine if the current documentation item needs task generation. If task generation is needed, it sets the has_task attribute of the current item to True.\\n\\nNext, the function iterates through the children of the current item recursively. For each child, it calls check_has_task recursively to check if the child or its descendants require task generation. It then updates the has_task attribute of the current item based on the has_task attribute of its children.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The check_has_task function is used to determine if a documentation item or its children require task generation.\\n- It utilizes the need_to_generate function to check if task generation is necessary for a specific item.\\n- The function recursively checks through the hierarchy of documentation items to update the has_task attribute accordingly.\\n\\nFunctionDef print_recursive(self, indent, print_content, diff_status, ignore_list)\\n\\nprint_recursive: The function of print_recursive is to recursively print the repository objects with proper indentation and formatting.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the class.\\n- indent (optional): An integer representing the current level of indentation. The default value is 0.\\n- print_content (optional): A boolean indicating whether to print the content of the objects. The default value is False.\\n- diff_status (optional): A boolean indicating whether to print the difference status of the objects. The default value is False.\\n- ignore_list (optional): A list of strings representing file paths to be ignored during printing. The default value is an empty list.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe print_recursive function is a recursive function that prints the repository objects in a hierarchical manner. It takes several optional parameters to control the printing behavior.\\n\\nThe function first defines a nested helper function called print_indent, which is used to generate the indentation string based on the current level of indentation. The indentation string is calculated by multiplying the indent parameter by two spaces and adding a \"|-\" character at the beginning.\\n\\nNext, the function determines the name to be printed for the current object. If the item_type attribute of the current object is DocItemType._repo, the name is set to the target repository name specified in the setting.project.target_repo variable. Otherwise, the name is set to the obj_name attribute of the current object.\\n\\nIf the diff_status parameter is True and the need_to_generate function returns True for the current object, indicating that the documentation needs to be generated or updated, the function prints the object type, name, and item status using the print_indent function for indentation.\\n\\nIf the diff_status parameter is False or the need_to_generate function returns False, the function prints only the object type and name using the print_indent function for indentation.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through the children of the current object and recursively calls the print_recursive function on each child, incrementing the indent parameter by 1. If the diff_status parameter is True and the child object does not have a task, indicating that it does not need to be generated or updated, the function skips printing the child.\\n\\nThe print_recursive function is primarily used in the print_hierarchy function and the diff function in the main.py file. In the print_hierarchy function, it is called on the target_repo_hierarchical_tree object of the MetaInfo class to print the hierarchy of the target repository. In the diff function, it is called on the target_repo_hierarchical_tree object of the new_meta_info variable to print the documents that will be generated or updated.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The print_recursive function is used to recursively print the repository objects with proper indentation and formatting.\\n- It takes several optional parameters to control the printing behavior, such as the level of indentation, whether to print the content of the objects, whether to print the difference status of the objects, and a list of file paths to be ignored during printing.\\n- The function uses the print_indent helper function to generate the indentation string.\\n- It determines the name to be printed for each object based on its item_type attribute.\\n- The function checks the diff_status parameter and the result of the need_to_generate function to decide whether to print the object\\'s item status.\\n- It recursively calls itself on the children of each object to print the hierarchy.\\n- The print_recursive function is called in the print_hierarchy and diff functions in the main.py file to print the hierarchy of the target repository and the documents that will be generated or updated, respectively.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n|-_dir: directory_name\\n  |-_file: file_name\\n    |-_class: class_name\\n      |-_function: function_name\\n      |-_sub_function: sub_function_name\\n  |-_file: file_name\\n    |-_class: class_name\\n      |-_class_function: class_function_name\\n\\nFunctionDef print_indent(indent)\\n\\nprint_indent: The function of print_indent is to generate an indented string with a specified number of spaces.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- indent: An integer representing the number of spaces for indentation.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe print_indent function takes an integer parameter called indent. If the indent value is 0, the function returns an empty string. Otherwise, it generates an indented string by concatenating the string \"  \" (two spaces) multiplied by the indent value, followed by \"|-\".\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the indent parameter is a non-negative integer to avoid any unexpected behavior.\\n- The function does not handle negative values for the indent parameter.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf print_indent(3) is called, the output will be \"      |-\".\\n\\nFunctionDef find_all_referencer(repo_path, variable_name, file_path, line_number, column_number, in_file_only)\\n\\nfind_all_referencer: The function of find_all_referencer is to locate all references to a specific variable in a given script file.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- repo_path: The path to the repository.\\n- variable_name: The name of the variable to search for.\\n- file_path: The path to the script file.\\n- line_number: The line number where the variable is located.\\n- column_number: The column number where the variable is located.\\n- in_file_only: A boolean flag to indicate whether to search for references only within the same file.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe find_all_referencer function utilizes the Jedi library to analyze the script file specified by file_path in the repository located at repo_path. It searches for references to the variable with the name variable_name at the provided line_number and column_number. If in_file_only is set to True, it restricts the search scope to the current file. The function then filters out references that match the variable_name and returns a list of tuples containing the relative path of the referencing file, line number, and column number. If an error occurs during the process, it logs the error message along with the relevant parameters and returns an empty list.\\n\\nIn the calling context, the function walk_file in the MetaInfo class iterates through variables in a file, calling find_all_referencer to identify references to each variable. It processes the reference list, skipping references from unstaged or untracked files, and handles references within the target repository\\'s hierarchical structure. Additionally, it manages special reference types and relationships between objects based on the references found.\\n\\nNote: Developers should ensure that the necessary parameters are provided correctly to execute the function successfully.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n[(\\'path/to/referencing_file.py\\', 10, 5), (\\'path/to/another_file.py\\', 20, 15)]\\n\\nClassDef MetaInfo\\n\\nMetaInfo: The MetaInfo class represents the metadata information for the documentation generation process. It stores various attributes and methods related to the generation and management of documentation.\\n\\nAttributes:\\n- repo_path: A string representing the path to the target repository.\\n- document_version: A string representing the version of the document. It is updated with the commit hash of the target repository.\\n- target_repo_hierarchical_tree: A DocItem object representing the hierarchical structure of the repository.\\n- white_list: A list of objects to be included in the documentation generation process.\\n- fake_file_reflection: A dictionary mapping fake file paths to their corresponding real file paths.\\n- jump_files: A list of file paths that are skipped during the documentation generation process.\\n- deleted_items_from_older_meta: A list of items (directories, files, or objects) that have been deleted from the previous version of the metadata.\\n- in_generation_process: A boolean value indicating whether the documentation generation process is currently in progress.\\n- checkpoint_lock: A threading lock used to ensure thread safety during the checkpointing process.\\n\\nMethods:\\n- init_meta_info(file_path_reflections, jump_files): Initializes the MetaInfo object from a repository path by generating the overall structure and setting the fake file reflections and jump files.\\n- from_checkpoint_path(checkpoint_dir_path): Loads the MetaInfo object from a checkpoint directory path, including the project hierarchy and metadata.\\n- checkpoint(target_dir_path, flash_reference_relation=False): Saves the MetaInfo object to the specified directory, including the project hierarchy and metadata.\\n- print_task_list(task_dict): Prints the remaining tasks to be done during the documentation generation process.\\n- get_all_files(): Returns a list of all file nodes in the repository.\\n- find_obj_with_lineno(file_node, start_line_num): Finds the object in the repository hierarchy that corresponds to the given file node and starting line number.\\n- parse_reference(): Parses the bidirectional reference relationships between objects in the repository.\\n- get_task_manager(now_node, task_available_func): Returns a TaskManager object that manages the tasks for generating documentation based on the given node and task availability function.\\n- get_topology(task_available_func): Calculates the topological order of objects in the repository based on the task availability function.\\n- load_doc_from_older_meta(older_meta): Loads the documentation from the older version of the metadata and merges it with the current metadata.\\n- from_project_hierarchy_path(repo_path): Creates a MetaInfo object from the project hierarchy JSON file.\\n- to_hierarchy_json(flash_reference_relation=False): Converts the metadata to a hierarchical JSON representation.\\n- from_project_hierarchy_json(project_hierarchy_json): Creates a MetaInfo object from the project hierarchy JSON dictionary.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe MetaInfo class is responsible for managing the metadata information related to the documentation generation process. It contains attributes to store information such as the repository path, document version, repository hierarchy, white list, fake file reflections, jump files, deleted items from the older metadata, and the status of the generation process.\\n\\nThe class provides methods to initialize the metadata from a repository path, load the metadata from a checkpoint directory, save the metadata to a directory, print the remaining tasks, get all file nodes in the repository, find the object corresponding to a file node and line number, parse the bidirectional reference relationships, calculate the topological order of objects, merge the documentation from the older metadata, convert the metadata to a hierarchical JSON representation, and create a MetaInfo object from the project hierarchy JSON.\\n\\nThe MetaInfo class plays a crucial role in managing the documentation generation process. It handles the detection of changes in the repository, generates and updates the documentation based on the changes, and maintains the metadata information for efficient generation and management of the documentation.\\n\\nNote: The MetaInfo class is used in conjunction with other classes and functions in the repository agent project to facilitate the generation and management of documentation. It is designed to be thread-safe and supports multi-threaded documentation generation.\\n\\nOutput Example: N/A\\n\\nFunctionDef init_meta_info(file_path_reflections, jump_files)\\n\\ninit_meta_info: The function of init_meta_info is to initialize the MetaInfo object by parsing the file structure and generating the hierarchical representation of the target repository.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- file_path_reflections (dict): A dictionary mapping the original file paths to their corresponding fake file paths.\\n- jump_files (list): A list of file paths to be ignored during parsing.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe init_meta_info function takes in the file_path_reflections and jump_files parameters. It first retrieves the absolute path of the target repository and prints a message indicating the initialization process.\\n\\nNext, it creates a FileHandler object with the project absolute path and None as the file path. It then calls the generate_overall_structure method of the FileHandler object to generate the overall structure of the repository. This method reads the project hierarchy JSON file, checks for ignored files, and generates the file structure for each file in the repository.\\n\\nAfter generating the repository structure, the function creates a new MetaInfo object and sets its attributes based on the generated structure. It assigns the project absolute path to the repo_path attribute and sets the fake_file_reflection and jump_files attributes to the provided parameters.\\n\\nFinally, the function returns the initialized metainfo object.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The init_meta_info function is a crucial step in initializing the MetaInfo object and constructing the hierarchical representation of the target repository.\\n- It relies on the FileHandler class to generate the overall structure of the repository.\\n- The file_path_reflections parameter should be a dictionary mapping the original file paths to their corresponding fake file paths.\\n- The jump_files parameter should be a list of file paths to be ignored during parsing.\\n- The returned metainfo object represents the hierarchical structure of the project and contains information about the repository path, fake file reflections, and jump files.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA MetaInfo object representing the hierarchical structure of the project.\\n\\nFunctionDef from_checkpoint_path(checkpoint_dir_path)\\n\\nfrom_checkpoint_path: The function of from_checkpoint_path is to read meta-information from an existing checkpoint directory and populate a MetaInfo object with the retrieved data.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- checkpoint_dir_path (str | Path): The path to the checkpoint directory containing the meta-information.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe from_checkpoint_path function reads the project_hierarchy.json and meta-info.json files from the specified checkpoint directory. It then extracts relevant meta-data from meta-info.json and assigns it to the corresponding attributes of the MetaInfo object. The function sets attributes such as repo_path, document_version, fake_file_reflection, jump_files, in_generation_process, and deleted_items_from_older_meta based on the data retrieved from meta-info.json.\\n\\nAdditionally, the function prints a message indicating the loading of MetaInfo from the checkpoint directory before returning the populated MetaInfo object.\\n\\nThis function relies on the MetaInfo class and the from_project_hierarchy_json function to construct and populate the MetaInfo object with hierarchical project information.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the checkpoint directory contains the necessary project_hierarchy.json and meta-info.json files for successful extraction of meta-information.\\n- The function assumes the presence of valid data in the meta-info.json file to populate the MetaInfo object accurately.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA MetaInfo object representing the meta-information loaded from the specified checkpoint directory.\\n\\nFunctionDef checkpoint(self, target_dir_path, flash_reference_relation)\\n\\ncheckpoint: The function of checkpoint is to save the MetaInfo object to the specified directory.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- target_dir_path (str): The path to the target directory where the MetaInfo will be saved.\\n- flash_reference_relation (bool, optional): Whether to include flash reference relation in the saved MetaInfo. Defaults to False.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe checkpoint function is responsible for saving the MetaInfo object to the specified directory. It performs several operations to store the MetaInfo and related information.\\n\\nFirst, the function acquires a lock using the checkpoint_lock attribute to ensure thread safety during the saving process. This prevents multiple threads from accessing and modifying the MetaInfo simultaneously.\\n\\nNext, the function prints a message indicating that the MetaInfo is being refreshed and saved. This serves as a visual confirmation for developers.\\n\\nThe function then checks if the target directory exists. If it does not, the function creates the directory using the os.makedirs method.\\n\\nAfterward, the function calls the to_hierarchy_json method of the MetaInfo object to convert the document metadata to a hierarchical JSON representation. This method retrieves information about each file node in the metadata and constructs a structured JSON representation. The flash_reference_relation parameter determines whether to include bidirectional reference relations in the JSON output.\\n\\nThe resulting hierarchical JSON representation is then written to a file named \"project_hierarchy.json\" in the target directory. This is achieved by opening the file in write mode using the open function, and then using the json.dump method to write the JSON data to the file. The indent parameter is set to 2 to format the JSON with indentation, and the ensure_ascii parameter is set to False to preserve non-ASCII characters.\\n\\nAdditionally, the function saves specific meta information to a separate file named \"meta-info.json\" in the target directory. This file contains information such as the document version, generation process status, fake file reflection, jump files, and deleted items from older meta. The meta information is stored in a dictionary and written to the file using the same process as the project hierarchy JSON file.\\n\\nOverall, the checkpoint function ensures that the MetaInfo object and related information are saved to the specified directory in a structured manner. This allows developers to persist and access the document metadata for future use.\\n\\nNote: Developers can use this function to save the MetaInfo object and associated metadata to a directory. This can be useful for storing and retrieving document information, such as object details, references, and version history.\\n\\nNote: The checkpoint function relies on the to_hierarchy_json method to convert the document metadata to a hierarchical JSON representation. It is recommended to call the checkpoint function after making any changes to the MetaInfo object to ensure that the updated information is saved.\\n\\nFunctionDef print_task_list(self, task_dict)\\n\\nprint_task_list: The function of print_task_list is to display a table of task information including task ID, generation reason, path, and dependencies.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- task_dict: A dictionary containing Task objects with task information.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe print_task_list function utilizes the PrettyTable library to create a table displaying task details. It iterates over the task_dict dictionary, extracting task ID, generation reason, path, and dependencies for each task. The dependencies are formatted as a string with a maximum length of 20 characters, showing a truncated list if longer. The function then prints the task table to the console.\\n\\nThis function is called within the Runner class in the run method to print the task list before processing tasks for document generation. It provides a clear overview of the tasks to be executed, aiding in task management and tracking during the document update process.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure the task_dict parameter contains Task objects with the required information for accurate table generation.\\n- The function output is displayed in a tabular format for easy readability and task tracking.\\n- Utilizes the PrettyTable library for table creation, requiring the library to be installed for proper functionality.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_all_files(self)\\n\\nget_all_files: The function of get_all_files is to retrieve all file nodes from the target repository hierarchical tree.\\n\\nParameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the MetaInfo class.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_all_files function starts by initializing an empty list called \"files\". It then defines a nested function called \"walk_tree\" that takes a node as an argument. The purpose of this function is to recursively traverse the hierarchical tree and append any file nodes to the \"files\" list.\\n\\nInside the \"walk_tree\" function, it checks if the current node\\'s item_type is equal to DocItemType._file. If it is, it appends the node to the \"files\" list. Then, it iterates over the children of the current node and recursively calls the \"walk_tree\" function for each child.\\n\\nAfter defining the \"walk_tree\" function, the get_all_files function calls it with the target_repo_hierarchical_tree as the starting node. This initiates the recursive traversal of the tree and populates the \"files\" list with all file nodes.\\n\\nFinally, the function returns the \"files\" list containing all the file nodes.\\n\\nNote:\\n- This function assumes that the target_repo_hierarchical_tree is a valid hierarchical tree structure.\\n- The function expects the target_repo_hierarchical_tree to have a \"children\" attribute that is a dictionary of child nodes.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n[<DocItem object at 0x000001>, <DocItem object at 0x000002>, ...]\\n\\nFunctionDef walk_tree(now_node)\\n\\nwalk_tree: The function of walk_tree is to recursively traverse a tree structure starting from a given node and collect all the leaf nodes of type _file.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_node: Represents the current node being traversed in the tree structure.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe walk_tree function takes a now_node as input and checks if the node\\'s item_type is of type _file. If it is a file node, the function appends the node to the files list. Then, the function recursively calls itself on each child node of the current node until all leaf nodes of type _file are collected.\\n\\nThe function utilizes a depth-first search approach to traverse the tree structure, ensuring that all leaf nodes of type _file are visited and added to the files list.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The walk_tree function is crucial for collecting all file nodes within a hierarchical tree structure, making it a fundamental part of the document processing workflow in the project.\\n\\nFunctionDef find_obj_with_lineno(self, file_node, start_line_num)\\n\\nfind_obj_with_lineno: The function of find_obj_with_lineno is to find the DocItem object that corresponds to a specific line number within a file.\\n\\nParameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the class.\\n- file_node: A DocItem object representing the file in which to search for the line number.\\n- start_line_num: An integer representing the line number to search for.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe find_obj_with_lineno function takes in a file_node, which is a DocItem object representing a file, and a start_line_num, which is the line number to search for within the file. The function iterates through the children of the file_node to find the DocItem object that corresponds to the given line number. It does this by checking if the start_line_num falls within the range of the child\\'s code_start_line and code_end_line. If a qualifying child is found, the function updates the now_node to the child and continues the search. If no qualifying child is found, the function returns the current now_node.\\n\\nThe function starts by assigning the file_node to the now_node variable. It then enters a while loop that continues until there are no more children to search. Within the loop, it iterates through the children of the now_node and checks if the start_line_num falls within the range of the child\\'s code_start_line and code_end_line. If a qualifying child is found, the now_node is updated to the child and the find_qualify_child flag is set to True. This ensures that the loop continues to search for children within the new now_node. If no qualifying child is found, the function returns the current now_node.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The assert statement is used to ensure that the now_node is not None before entering the while loop.\\n- The function assumes that the file_node and its children have the necessary attributes (code_start_line, code_end_line) to perform the line number comparison.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA DocItem object representing the code block that corresponds to the given line number within the file.\\n\\nFunctionDef parse_reference(self)\\n\\nparse_reference: The function of parse_reference is to extract bidirectional reference relationships for all objects.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the object.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe parse_reference function is a method of the MetaInfo class. It is used to extract bidirectional reference relationships for all objects in the target repository. The function starts by calling the get_all_files method to retrieve all file nodes from the target repository hierarchical tree.\\n\\nNext, the function initializes two empty lists, white_list_file_names and white_list_obj_names, which will be used to store the names of files and objects in a whitelist. If a whitelist is specified, the function populates these lists with the corresponding names from the whitelist.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through each file node in the file_nodes list. For each file node, it performs the following steps:\\n\\nIt checks if the file node\\'s full name ends with a specific substring (latest_verison_substring). If it does, it raises an assertion error.\\n\\nIt retrieves the relative file path of the file node.\\n\\nIt checks if the relative file path is present in the jump_files list. If it is, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nIf the white_list_file_names list is not empty and the file node\\'s file name is not present in the white_list_file_names list, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nIt defines a nested function called walk_file, which takes a DocItem object as an argument. This function is used to traverse all variables within a file.\\n\\nInside the walk_file function, it first checks if the white_list_obj_names list is not empty and the current object\\'s name is not present in the white_list_obj_names list. If it is, it sets the in_file_only variable to True. This variable is used to indicate that only references within the same file should be considered.\\n\\nIt calls the find_all_referencer function to find all references to the current object within the file. The function takes several parameters, including the repository path, variable name, file path, line number, column number, and in_file_only flag. It returns a list of reference positions.\\n\\nFor each reference position in the reference_list, the function performs the following steps:\\n\\na. It retrieves the file path of the referencer.\\n\\nb. It checks if the referencer file path is present in the fake_file_reflection dictionary. If it is, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nc. It checks if the referencer file path is present in the jump_files list. If it is, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nd. It splits the referencer file path into a list of hierarchical levels.\\n\\ne. It calls the find method on the target_repo_hierarchical_tree to find the referencer file item based on the hierarchical levels. If the file item is not found, it prints an error message and continues to the next iteration.\\n\\nf. It calls the find_obj_with_lineno method to find the referencer node within the referencer file item based on the line number. If the node\\'s name is the same as the current object\\'s name, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\ng. It checks if there is an ancestor relationship between the current object and the referencer node. If there is, it skips the current iteration.\\n\\nh. It checks if the referencer node is already in the reference_who list of the current object. If it is not, it appends the referencer node to the reference_who list and appends the current object to the who_reference_me list of the referencer node. It also increments the ref_count variable.\\n\\nFinally, the function calls the walk_file function for each child of the file_node.\\n\\nAfter iterating through all file nodes, the function returns the ref_count variable, which represents the total number of bidirectional reference relationships found.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The parse_reference function assumes that the target repository hierarchical tree is a valid hierarchical tree structure.\\n- The function relies on the get_all_files, find_all_referencer, find_obj_with_lineno, and find methods to retrieve relevant information from the target repository.\\n- The function uses the white_list_file_names and white_list_obj_names lists to filter the objects for which bidirectional reference relationships are extracted.\\n- The function prints certain messages during the execution, which can provide additional information for debugging purposes.\\n\\nFunctionDef walk_file(now_obj)\\n\\nwalk_file: The walk_file function is responsible for traversing all variables within a file and finding their references.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_obj (DocItem): The current DocItem object representing the variable to be traversed.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe walk_file function is a recursive function that takes a DocItem object as input and traverses all variables within a file. It starts by checking if there is a whitelist of object names and if the current object is not in the whitelist. If this condition is met, the function sets the in_file_only flag to True, indicating that only references within the same file should be considered.\\n\\nThe function then calls the find_all_referencer function to find all references to the current variable. It passes the repository path, variable name, file path, line number, column number, and in_file_only flag as parameters. The find_all_referencer function utilizes the Jedi library to analyze the script file and returns a list of tuples containing the referencing file\\'s relative path, line number, and column number.\\n\\nNext, the function iterates through the reference list and performs the following checks for each reference:\\n- If the reference is from an unstaged file (not yet committed to the repository), it skips the reference and prints a message indicating that it is from an unstaged version.\\n- If the reference is from an untracked file (not yet added to the repository), it skips the reference and prints a message indicating that it is from an untracked version.\\n- If the reference is from a file that is reflected in the repository hierarchy (fake file), it skips the reference.\\n- If the reference is from a file that is not found in the target repository, it prints an error message indicating that the file is not in the repository.\\n\\nFor each valid reference, the function retrieves the corresponding DocItem object from the repository hierarchy using the file\\'s hierarchical path. It then checks if the referencer node has the same name as the current object. If they have the same name, it skips the reference.\\n\\nIf there is no ancestor relationship between the current object and the referencer node, the function adds the referencer node to the reference_who list of the current object and adds the current object to the who_reference_me list of the referencer node. It also increments the ref_count variable to keep track of the number of references.\\n\\nFinally, the function recursively calls itself for each child of the current object to traverse all variables within the file.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The walk_file function is called within the MetaInfo class in the doc_meta_info.py file.\\n- The function relies on the find_all_referencer function to locate references to variables.\\n- It handles different types of references, skips certain types of references, and updates the reference relationships between objects.\\n- The function uses various flags and variables to control the traversal and reference tracking process.\\n- It prints messages for skipped references and error messages for files not found in the repository.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_task_manager(self, now_node, task_available_func)\\n\\nget_task_manager: The function of get_task_manager is to generate a TaskManager object that manages tasks based on the topology of objects in the repository.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self (object): The current instance of the MetaInfo class.\\n- now_node (DocItem): The current DocItem node representing the starting point for generating the task manager.\\n- task_available_func (function): A function that determines if a DocItem node is available for task generation.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_task_manager function is responsible for generating a TaskManager object that manages tasks based on the topology of objects in the repository. The function takes in the current instance of the MetaInfo class, the starting DocItem node (now_node), and a task_available_func function as parameters.\\n\\nThe function begins by retrieving a list of DocItem nodes using the get_travel_list method of the now_node. This method performs a pre-order traversal of the tree structure, with the root node being the first element in the resulting list. The list of DocItem nodes is then filtered based on the white_list attribute of the MetaInfo instance, if it is not None. The in_white_list function is used to filter the DocItem nodes based on their file path and ID text.\\n\\nNext, the doc_items list is further filtered using the task_available_func function. This function determines if a DocItem node is available for task generation based on certain criteria. The filtered doc_items list is then sorted based on the depth of the DocItem nodes, with leaf nodes appearing first.\\n\\nThe function initializes an empty deal_items list to keep track of processed DocItem nodes and creates a TaskManager object. It also initializes a progress bar using the tqdm library to display the progress of parsing the topology task-list.\\n\\nThe function enters a while loop that continues until all DocItem nodes in the doc_items list have been processed. Within the loop, the function searches for the DocItem node with the minimum break level. The break level represents the number of dependencies that need to be resolved before the DocItem node can be processed. If a DocItem node has a break level of 0, it means that it has no unresolved dependencies and can be processed immediately.\\n\\nFor each DocItem node, the function calculates the break level by counting the number of dependencies on its children and referenced nodes. The break level is divided into two parts: the best_break_level, which includes all dependencies, and the second_best_break_level, which excludes special references. The function then selects the DocItem node with the minimum second_best_break_level as the target_item.\\n\\nIf the minimum break level is greater than 0, it means that there is a circular reference or unresolved dependency. The function prints a warning message indicating the level and name of the target_item.\\n\\nThe function then retrieves the task IDs of the DocItem node\\'s children and referenced nodes from the task_manager. These task IDs represent the dependencies of the target_item. If the task_available_func is None or returns True for the target_item, a new task is added to the task_manager with the retrieved task IDs as dependencies. The target_item is marked with the task ID and added to the deal_items list. Finally, the target_item is removed from the doc_items list, and the progress bar is updated.\\n\\nOnce all DocItem nodes have been processed, the function returns the task_manager.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The get_task_manager function assumes a hierarchical tree structure of DocItem nodes.\\n- Circular references or unresolved dependencies may occur in the tree structure, and the function handles them by selecting the DocItem node with the best break level.\\n- The task_available_func function is used to filter DocItem nodes based on certain criteria. It determines if a DocItem node is available for task generation.\\n- Ensure proper synchronization when accessing and modifying tasks in a multi-threaded environment.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA TaskManager object that manages tasks based on the topology of objects in the repository.\\n\\nFunctionDef in_white_list(item)\\n\\nin_white_list: The function of in_white_list is to check if an item is in the white list based on its file name and object name.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- item: Represents the item to be checked against the white list.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe in_white_list function iterates through the white_list attribute of the current object. It compares the file name and object name of the input item with the corresponding values in each element of the white list. If a match is found, the function returns True, indicating that the item is in the white list. If no match is found after iterating through all elements, the function returns False.\\n\\nThis function is essential for determining whether a specific item is allowed based on predefined criteria stored in the white list. It provides a mechanism to control access or perform specific actions on items based on their file name and object name.\\n\\nNote: It is crucial to ensure that the white_list attribute is correctly populated with the necessary file names and object names for accurate evaluation.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If the white list contains elements with file_path=\"example.py\" and id_text=\"example_id\", and the input item has a file name of \"example.py\" and an object name of \"example_id\", the function will return True.\\n\\nFunctionDef get_topology(self, task_available_func)\\n\\nget_topology: The function of get_topology is to calculate the topological order of all objects in the repository.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self (object): The current instance of the MetaInfo class.\\n- task_available_func (function): A function that determines if a DocItem node is available for task generation.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe get_topology function is responsible for calculating the topological order of all objects in the repository. It takes in the current instance of the MetaInfo class and a task_available_func function as parameters.\\n\\nThe function first calls the parse_reference method to extract bidirectional reference relationships for all objects in the repository. This method retrieves all file nodes from the target repository hierarchical tree and iterates through each file node to extract the references.\\n\\nNext, the function calls the get_task_manager method to generate a TaskManager object that manages tasks based on the topology of objects in the repository. This method retrieves a list of DocItem nodes using the get_travel_list method of the starting DocItem node. The list is then filtered based on the white_list attribute of the MetaInfo instance and the task_available_func function. The filtered list is sorted based on the depth of the DocItem nodes, with leaf nodes appearing first.\\n\\nThe function initializes a deal_items list to keep track of processed DocItem nodes and creates a TaskManager object.

The function prints a warning message indicating the level and name of the target_item.\\n\\nThe function retrieves the task IDs of the DocItem node\\'s children and referenced nodes from the task_manager. These task IDs represent the dependencies of the target_item. If the task_available_func is None or returns True for the target_item, a new task is added to the task_manager with the retrieved task IDs as dependencies. The target_item is marked with the task ID and added to the deal_items list. Finally, the target_item is removed from the list, and the progress bar is updated.\\n\\nOnce all DocItem nodes have been processed, the function returns the task_manager.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The get_topology function assumes a hierarchical tree structure of DocItem nodes.\\n- Circular references or unresolved dependencies may occur in the tree structure, and the function handles them by selecting the DocItem node with the best break level.\\n- The task_available_func function is used to filter DocItem nodes based on certain criteria.

For each node visited, the deal_func function is called with the current node as an argument. Then, the function iterates over all child nodes of the current node and recursively applies the same operation to each child node.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the deal_func parameter is a valid Callable object that can accept a single argument representing a node in the hierarchical tree.\\n- Be cautious when using this function with large or deeply nested tree structures to avoid potential stack overflow issues.\\n\\nFunctionDef travel(now_item)\\n\\ntravel: The function of travel is to recursively traverse through the children of a given DocItem object and call the deal_func function on each child.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_item: Represents the current DocItem object being traversed.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe travel function takes a DocItem object as input and first calls the deal_func function on the current object. It then iterates through the children of the current object using a for loop and recursively calls the travel function on each child. This process continues until all children have been traversed.\\n\\nThe function essentially performs a depth-first traversal of the tree structure represented by the DocItem objects, visiting each node and its children in a systematic manner.\\n\\nFrom a functional perspective, the travel function is crucial for navigating through the hierarchical structure of DocItem objects, allowing for operations to be performed on each node and its children as needed.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The travel function relies on the deal_func function to process each DocItem object during traversal.\\n- It is important to ensure that the input now_item is a valid DocItem object to avoid any errors during traversal.\\n\\nFunctionDef load_doc_from_older_meta(self, older_meta)\\n\\nload_doc_from_older_meta: The function of load_doc_from_older_meta is to merge the documentation from an older version of the meta info into the current version.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- older_meta (MetaInfo): The meta info object representing the older version of the documentation.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe load_doc_from_older_meta function is a method of the MetaInfo class. It takes an older_meta object as a parameter, which represents the meta info of the older version of the documentation. The function merges the documentation from the older version into the current version.\\n\\nThe function starts by logging an informational message indicating that the documentation is being merged from an older version of the meta info. It then retrieves the root item of the new version of the meta info.\\n\\nNext, the function defines a nested function called find_item, which is used to find an item in the new version of the meta info based on its original item in the older version. This function takes a DocItem object as a parameter and returns the corresponding item in the new version of the meta info if found, otherwise it returns None.\\n\\nInside the find_item function, it checks if the current item is the root node. If it is, it returns the root item of the new version. Otherwise, it recursively calls itself on the parent item of the current item until it finds the corresponding item in the new version.\\n\\nAfter defining the find_item function, the function defines another nested function called travel, which is used to traverse the items in the older version of the meta info and update the corresponding items in the new version. This function takes a DocItem object as a parameter.\\n\\nInside the travel function, it first calls the find_item function to find the corresponding item in the new version based on the current item in the older version. If the corresponding item is not found, it adds the current item to the deleted_items list and returns.\\n\\nIf the corresponding item is found, it updates the markdown content and status of the corresponding item in the new version based on the current item in the older version. If the code content of the current item in the older version is different from the code content of the corresponding item in the new version, it sets the status of the corresponding item to \"code_changed\".\\n\\nThen, it recursively calls the travel function on each child item of the current item in the older version.\\n\\nAfter defining the travel function, the function calls the travel function on the root item of the older version of the meta info to start the traversal process.\\n\\nNext, the function calls the parse_reference method of the current object to parse the reference relationships in the new version of the meta info.\\n\\nAfter that, the function defines another nested function called travel2, which is similar to the travel function but is used to update the reference relationships in the new version of the meta info. This function takes a DocItem object as a parameter.\\n\\nInside the travel2 function, it first calls the find_item function to find the corresponding item in the new version based on the current item in the older version. If the corresponding item is not found, it returns.\\n\\nThen, it compares the list of new reference names with the list of old reference names for the current item. If the lists are not equal and the status of the corresponding item in the new version is \"doc_up_to_date\", it updates the status of the corresponding item based on the changes in the reference relationships.\\n\\nFinally, it recursively calls the travel2 function on each child item of the current item in the older version.\\n\\nAfter defining the travel2 function, the function calls the travel2 function on the root item of the older version of the meta info to update the reference relationships in the new version.\\n\\nThe function stores the deleted items from the older version of the meta info in the deleted_items list.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The load_doc_from_older_meta function assumes that the target repository hierarchical tree is a valid hierarchical tree structure.\\n- The function relies on the find_item function to find the corresponding items in the new version of the meta info.\\n- The function uses the travel function to update the markdown content and status of the items in the new version based on the items in the older version.\\n- The function uses the travel2 function to update the reference relationships in the new version based on the reference relationships in the older version.\\n- The function calls the parse_reference method to extract bidirectional reference relationships for all objects in the new version of the meta info.\\n- The function updates the deleted_items_from_older_meta attribute of the current object with the deleted items from the older version of the meta info.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\ndeleted_items_from_older_meta: [[\\'item_name1\\', \\'item_type1\\'], [\\'item_name2\\', \\'item_type2\\'], ...]\\n\\nFunctionDef find_item(now_item)\\n\\nfind_item: The function of find_item is to search for an item in the new version of meta based on its original item.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_item (DocItem): The original item to be found in the new version of meta.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe find_item function recursively searches for an item in the new version of meta based on the provided original item. It traverses the meta structure to locate the corresponding item in the new version by comparing names and relationships. If the item is found, it returns the corresponding item; otherwise, it returns None.\\n\\nThe function first checks if the provided item is the root node. If it is, the root item is returned as the root node can always be found. Then, it recursively searches for the item\\'s father and compares the names of the children to find the real name of the item. After finding the real name, it checks if the item exists in the children of the father node in the new version. If found, it returns the corresponding item; otherwise, it returns None.\\n\\nThis function is crucial for mapping items from an older version of meta to the new version, ensuring consistency and accuracy in the meta information.\\n\\nNote: Developers should ensure that the provided now_item parameter is a valid DocItem object to avoid unexpected behavior.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n```python\\nresult_item = find_item(now_item)\\n\\nExample return value\\n\\nresult_item: DocItem or None\\n\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef travel(now_older_item)\\n\\ntravel: The function of travel is to recursively search for an item in the new version of meta based on its original item. It traverses the meta structure and compares names and relationships to locate the corresponding item in the new version. If the item is found, it updates the metadata of the result item with the metadata of the original item. If the item is not found, it adds the name and type of the original item to a list of deleted items.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_older_item (DocItem): The original item to be found in the new version of meta.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe travel function is a recursive function that searches for an item in the new version of meta based on its original item. It takes the now_older_item parameter, which represents the original item to be found in the new version of meta.\\n\\nThe function first calls the find_item function to search for the corresponding item in the new version of meta. If the item is not found, it adds the name and type of the original item to a list of deleted items and returns. If the item is found, it updates the metadata of the result item with the metadata of the original item.\\n\\nNext, the function checks if the source code of the original item has been modified. It compares the code_content attribute of the original item with the code_content attribute of the result item. If the source code has been modified, it updates the item_status attribute of the result item to DocItemStatus.code_changed.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through the children of the original item and recursively calls the travel function for each child. This allows the function to traverse the entire hierarchy of the original item and update the corresponding items in the new version of meta.\\n\\nOverall, the travel function is responsible for updating the metadata of items in the new version of meta based on their original items. It ensures that the metadata remains consistent and up to date, especially when the source code has been modified.\\n\\nNote: It is important to note that the travel function relies on the find_item function to locate the corresponding item in the new version of meta. The find_item function recursively searches for an item by comparing names and relationships. It is a crucial component of the travel function and ensures the accuracy of the metadata update process.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n```python\\n\\nExample usage of the travel function\\n\\nnow_older_item = DocItem(...)\\ntravel(now_older_item)\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef travel2(now_older_item)\\n\\ntravel2: The function of travel2 is to recursively traverse the hierarchy of DocItem objects and update their item_status based on changes in their references.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_older_item (DocItem): The original DocItem object to be processed.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe travel2 function takes a now_older_item parameter, which is a DocItem object representing the original item. The function recursively traverses the hierarchy of DocItem objects starting from the now_older_item and updates their item_status based on changes in their references.\\n\\nThe function first calls the find_item function to find the corresponding item in the new version of meta based on the now_older_item. If the item is not found, the function returns.\\n\\nNext, the function compares the references of the result_item (the corresponding item in the new version) with the references of the now_older_item. It retrieves the names of the objects that reference the result_item and the now_older_item and stores them in new_reference_names and old_reference_names respectively.\\n\\nThe function then checks if the set of new_reference_names is different from the set of old_reference_names and if the result_item is up to date (item_status is DocItemStatus.doc_up_to_date). If both conditions are met, it further checks if the set of new_reference_names is a subset of the set of old_reference_names. If it is, it updates the item_status of the result_item to DocItemStatus.referencer_not_exist, indicating that some references to the item have been removed. Otherwise, it updates the item_status to DocItemStatus.add_new_referencer, indicating that new references to the item have been added.\\n\\nFinally, the function recursively calls itself for each child of the now_older_item to update their item_status as well.\\n\\nNote: The travel2 function is an important part of the documentation generation process in the project. It is responsible for updating the item_status of DocItem objects based on changes in their references. This helps to track the status of documentation items and determine whether they need to be generated or updated. Developers should ensure that the now_older_item parameter is a valid DocItem object to avoid unexpected behavior.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n```python\\n\\nExample usage of the travel2 function\\n\\nnow_older_item = DocItem(...)\\ntravel2(now_older_item)\\n\\nThe item_status of the DocItem objects in the hierarchy has been updated based on changes in their references.\\n\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef from_project_hierarchy_path(repo_path)\\n\\nfrom_project_hierarchy_path: The function of from_project_hierarchy_path is to parse a JSON representation of a project hierarchy, extract information from the specified repository path, and convert it into a structured MetaInfo object.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- repo_path (str): The path to the repository containing the project_hierarchy.json file.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe from_project_hierarchy_path function first constructs the path to the project_hierarchy.json file within the specified repository path. It then checks the existence of the file and raises an error if it does not exist.\\n\\nSubsequently, the function reads the content of the project_hierarchy.json file, parses it as JSON, and stores it in the project_hierarchy_json variable. It then calls the from_project_hierarchy_json function from MetaInfo to convert the JSON representation into a hierarchical structure represented by a MetaInfo object.\\n\\nThe from_project_hierarchy_json function processes the project_hierarchy_json data by creating DocItem objects to represent directories, files, and their contents. It establishes parent-child relationships between items based on code start and end lines, updates item types, and parses tree paths to organize the hierarchical structure.\\n\\nFinally, the function returns a MetaInfo object that encapsulates the hierarchical structure of the project extracted from the project_hierarchy.json file.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The from_project_hierarchy_path function serves as a bridge between the raw JSON representation of the project hierarchy and the structured MetaInfo object.\\n- It relies on the from_project_hierarchy_json function to handle the detailed parsing and structuring of the project hierarchy data.\\n- Ensure that the repo_path parameter points to a valid repository containing the project_hierarchy.json file for successful execution of the function.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nA MetaInfo object representing the hierarchical structure of the project.\\n\\nFunctionDef to_hierarchy_json(self, flash_reference_relation)\\n\\nto_hierarchy_json: The function of to_hierarchy_json is to convert the document metadata to a hierarchical JSON representation.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- flash_reference_relation (bool): If True, the latest bidirectional reference relations will be written back to the meta file.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe to_hierarchy_json function iterates through all file nodes in the document metadata and constructs a hierarchical JSON representation. It retrieves information such as the object\\'s name, type, content, markdown content, and status. If the flash_reference_relation parameter is True, it includes bidirectional reference relations in the JSON output. The function recursively traverses the hierarchy of each file node to capture all nested objects and their details.\\n\\nThe function utilizes the get_full_name method to retrieve the full name of each object in the hierarchy. It populates the JSON structure with relevant metadata for each object, including references to and from other objects if specified. By organizing the metadata in a hierarchical JSON format, it provides a structured overview of the document\\'s content and relationships between objects.\\n\\nNote: Developers can use this function to generate a structured representation of document metadata, including object details and relationships, in a hierarchical JSON format.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n{\\n    \"FileA\": [\\n        {\\n            \"name\": \"ObjectA\",\\n            \"type\": \"TypeA\",\\n            \"md_content\": \"Markdown content here\",\\n            \"item_status\": \"StatusA\",\\n            \"who_reference_me\": [\"ObjectB\"],\\n            \"reference_who\": [\"ObjectC\"],\\n            \"special_reference_type\": \"SpecialType\"\\n        },\\n        {\\n            \"name\": \"ObjectB\",\\n            \"type\": \"TypeB\",\\n            \"md_content\": \"Markdown content here\",\\n            \"item_status\": \"StatusB\",\\n            \"who_reference_me\": [\"ObjectA\"],\\n            \"reference_who\": [\"ObjectC\"],\\n            \"special_reference_type\": \"SpecialType\"\\n        }\\n    ],\\n    \"FileB\": [\\n        {\\n            \"name\": \"ObjectX\",\\n            \"type\": \"TypeX\",\\n            \"md_content\": \"Markdown content here\",\\n            \"item_status\": \"StatusX\",\\n            \"who_reference_me\": [\"ObjectY\"],\\n            \"reference_who\": [\"ObjectZ\"],\\n            \"special_reference_type\": \"SpecialType\"\\n        }\\n    ]\\n}\\n\\nFunctionDef walk_file(now_obj)\\n\\nwalk_file: The function of walk_file is to recursively traverse a hierarchy of DocItem objects and update the content of each object in a JSON-like format.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- now_obj: The current DocItem object being processed.\\n\\nThe function then recursively calls walk_file on each child of the current DocItem object.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The to_str function of the DocItemType class is used to convert the item_type of a DocItem object to a string representation.\\n- The flash_reference_relation flag determines whether to include detailed reference information in the JSON object.\\n\\nFunctionDef from_project_hierarchy_json(project_hierarchy_json)\\n\\nfrom_project_hierarchy_json: The function of from_project_hierarchy_json is to parse a JSON representation of a project hierarchy and construct a MetaInfo object that represents the hierarchical structure of the project.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- project_hierarchy_json (dict): A dictionary representing the project hierarchy in JSON format.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe from_project_hierarchy_json function takes in a project_hierarchy_json parameter, which is a dictionary representing the project hierarchy in JSON format. The function initializes a target_meta_info object of type MetaInfo and sets its target_repo_hierarchical_tree attribute to a DocItem object representing the root node of the hierarchical tree.\\n\\nThe function then iterates through each file in the project_hierarchy_json dictionary. For each file, it checks if the file exists and is not empty in the target repository. If the file does not exist or is empty, it logs a message and skips to the next file.\\n\\nNext, the function splits the file path into a list of directories and iterates through each directory in the file path. It checks if the directory already exists as a child of the current node in the hierarchical tree. If the directory does not exist, it creates a new DocItem object representing the directory and adds it as a child of the current node. It then updates the current node to the newly created directory node.\\n\\nAfter processing the directories in the file path, the function creates a new DocItem object representing the file and adds it as a child of the current node.\\n\\nThe function then processes the content of the file. It asserts that the file content is of type list and iterates through each item in the content. For each item, it creates a new DocItem object representing the item and adds it as a child of the file node.

If the content type is \"FunctionDef\", it sets the item_type to _function. Additionally, if the current item is a function and its parent is a class, the item_type is set to _class_function.

It appends the base name of the current directory to the structure list after applying the provided prefix. Then, it iterates over the sorted list of items in the current directory. If an item starts with a \".\", it is skipped to ignore hidden files and directories. For each item, it constructs the full path and checks if it is a directory or a Python file (.py extension). If it is a directory, the function is called recursively with the new path and an increased indentation level.

The generated documentation is appended to the md_content attribute of the DocItem object, and the item_status is updated accordingly.\\n\\nThe first_generate method is used to generate all documents in the project. It checks the availability of each task using the need_to_generate function and generates the documentation using the generate_doc_for_a_single_item method. It updates the meta_info object and saves the document version. If the .project_hierarchy folder does not exist, it creates fake files and initializes the meta_info object. If the folder exists, it loads the meta_info object from the checkpoint. After generating the documents, it saves the updated meta_info object and generates a summary if a README file is not present.\\n\\nThe markdown_refresh method is responsible for writing the latest document information to a folder in markdown format. It deletes the existing contents in the markdown folder and writes the updated markdown content for each file in the meta_info object.\\n\\nThe git_commit method is used to commit the changes to the repository. It takes a commit message as an argument and uses the subprocess module to execute the git commit command.\\n\\nThe run method is the main method that executes the document update process.

It starts by retrieving the relative file path of the doc_item using the get_full_name method.\\n\\nNext, it checks if the doc_item needs to be generated by calling the need_to_generate function. If the doc_item does not need to be generated, it prints a message indicating that the content is ignored or the document is already generated, and the function returns.\\n\\nIf the doc_item needs to be generated, the function proceeds to generate the documentation. It prints a message indicating the start of the document generation process, including the type and full name of the object.\\n\\nThe function creates a FileHandler object to handle file-related operations. It initializes the FileHandler object with the target repository and the relative file path of the doc_item.\\n\\nThe function then calls the generate_doc method of the ChatEngine class, passing the doc_item and the file_handler as parameters. This method is responsible for generating the documentation by interacting with the OpenAI chat model. The generated documentation is stored in the md_content attribute of the doc_item.\\n\\nAfter generating the documentation, the function updates the status of the doc_item to indicate that the documentation is up to date. It also checks if there was an exception during the document generation process. If an exception occurred, it logs an error message and updates the status of the doc_item to indicate that the documentation has not been generated.\\n\\nFinally, the function calls the checkpoint method of the meta_info object to save the updated MetaInfo object to the specified directory.\\n\\nNote: The generate_doc_for_a_single_item function generates documentation for a given object. It interacts with the OpenAI chat model and updates the MetaInfo object to keep track of the documentation status.

It performs the document generation process in a specific order, synchronizing the generated documents back to the file system in real-time. The function also handles errors during the generation process and continues generating documents in the specified order.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the object.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe first_generate function is responsible for generating all documents in the target repository. It starts by logging an information message indicating the start of the document generation process.\\n\\nThe function then defines a check_task_available_func function using the partial method. This function is used to determine whether a documentation item needs to be generated based on its status and other conditions. It is passed as a parameter to the get_topology method of the meta_info attribute.\\n\\nThe get_topology method is called to calculate the topological order of all objects in the repository. It retrieves the hierarchical tree structure of the target repository and generates a TaskManager object that manages tasks based on the topology of objects. The task_available_func parameter is set to the check_task_available_func function.\\n\\nNext, the function initializes a variable before_task_len to store the number of tasks in the task_manager before generating the documents.\\n\\nThe function checks if the current instance of the object is in the generation process. If it is not, it sets the in_generation_process attribute of the meta_info object to True and logs an information message indicating the initialization of a new task list. If it is in the generation process, it logs an information message indicating the loading of an existing task list.\\n\\nThe function then calls the print_task_list method of the meta_info object to display a table of task information, including task ID, generation reason, path, and dependencies.\\n\\nInside a try-except block, the function sets the sync_func attribute of the task_manager to the markdown_refresh method. This method is responsible for writing the latest document information to a folder in markdown format.\\n\\nThe function creates a list of threads, where each thread represents a worker that performs tasks assigned by the task_manager. The number of threads is determined by the max_thread_count attribute in the project setting.\\n\\nThe threads are started and joined, ensuring that all tasks are completed before proceeding.\\n\\nAfter the document generation process is completed, the function updates the document_version attribute of the meta_info object with the commit hash of the latest version of the code repository. It also sets the in_generation_process attribute of the meta_info object to False and calls the checkpoint method of the meta_info object to save the updated MetaInfo object to the specified directory.\\n\\nFinally, the function logs an information message indicating the number of documents successfully generated during the process.\\n\\nNote: \\n- The first_generate function is used to generate all documents in the target repository.\\n- It calculates the topological order of objects in the repository and generates documents in the specified order.\\n- It handles errors during the generation process and continues generating documents.\\n- The check_task_available_func function is used to determine whether a documentation item needs to be generated based on its status and other conditions.\\n- The sync_func attribute of the task_manager is set to the markdown_refresh method, which writes the latest document information to a folder in markdown format.\\n- The number of threads for document generation is determined by the max_thread_count attribute in the project setting.\\n- The document_version attribute of the meta_info object is updated with the commit hash of the latest version of the code repository.\\n- The checkpoint method of the meta_info object is called to save the updated MetaInfo object to the specified directory.\\n\\nNote: During the first_generate process, the target repository code cannot be modified. In other words, the generation process of a document must be bound to a specific version of the code.\\n\\nFunctionDef markdown_refresh(self)\\n\\nmarkdown_refresh: The function of markdown_refresh is to write the latest document information to a folder in markdown format, regardless of whether the markdown content has changed.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- self: The current instance of the object.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe markdown_refresh function is a method of the Runner class. It is responsible for updating the markdown documents based on the latest document information. The function starts by acquiring a lock using the runner_lock attribute to ensure thread safety.\\n\\nWithin the function, the markdown_folder variable is set to the target repository path appended with the markdown_docs_name attribute from the project setting. This represents the folder where the markdown documents will be stored. If the markdown_folder already exists, it is deleted using the shutil.rmtree function to remove all its contents. Then, a new directory is created using the os.mkdir function.\\n\\nThe file_item_list is obtained by calling the get_all_files method of the meta_info attribute. This method retrieves all file nodes from the target repository hierarchical tree.\\n\\nNext, the function iterates over each file_item in the file_item_list. For each file_item, it checks if there is any documentation inside the file_item or its children by calling the recursive_check function.\\n\\nThe recursive_check function is defined within the markdown_refresh function. It takes a doc_item as a parameter and recursively checks if there is any documentation inside the doc_item or its children. It returns True if documentation is found, and False otherwise.\\n\\nIf recursive_check returns False for a file_item, it means that there is no documentation inside the file_item or its children. In this case, the function skips the file_item and continues to the next iteration.\\n\\nIf recursive_check returns True for a file_item, it means that there is documentation inside the file_item or its children. The rel_file_path variable is set to the full name of the file_item using the get_full_name method. This represents the relative file path of the file_item within the target repository.\\n\\nThe to_markdown function is defined within the markdown_refresh function. It takes an item and a now_level as parameters and recursively converts the item and its children to markdown format. The function starts by initializing an empty string called markdown_content. It then appends the appropriate markdown headers and content based on the item\\'s properties, such as item_type, obj_name, and md_content. The function also handles the case where the item has parameters by appending them to the markdown_content. It recursively calls itself for each child of the item and appends the returned markdown content. Finally, it returns the markdown_content.\\n\\nThe markdown variable is initialized as an empty string. For each child in the children of the file_item, the to_markdown function is called with the child and a now_level of 2. The returned markdown content is appended to the markdown variable. After iterating over all children, the markdown variable should contain the markdown representation of the file_item and its children.\\n\\nThe assert statement is used to ensure that the markdown variable is not None. If it is None, an AssertionError is raised with the file path of the file_item.\\n\\nThe file_path variable is set to the file path of the markdown file, which is derived from the file_item\\'s file name by replacing the \".py\" extension with \".md\". The abs_file_path variable is set to the target repository path appended with the file_path. The directories leading to the abs_file_path are created if they do not exist using the os.makedirs function. Finally, the markdown content is written to the abs_file_path using the open function.\\n\\nAfter iterating over all file_items, an information message is logged indicating the successful refresh of the markdown documents at the markdown_docs_name location in the project setting.\\n\\nNote:\\n- The markdown_refresh function updates the markdown documents based on the latest document information.\\n- It deletes the existing markdown folder and creates a new one.\\n- It iterates over all file items and checks if there is any documentation inside each file item or its children.\\n- It converts the file items and their children to markdown format using the to_markdown function.\\n- It writes the markdown content to the corresponding markdown files.\\n- The function ensures thread safety by acquiring a lock using the runner_lock attribute.\\n- The function logs an information message indicating the successful refresh of the markdown documents.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nIf the markdown_refresh function is successful, an information message will be logged indicating the successful refresh of the markdown documents at the specified location.\\n\\nFunctionDef recursive_check(doc_item)\\n\\nrecursive_check: The function of recursive_check is to check if there is a document inside a file.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- doc_item: Represents a DocItem object which contains information about the document.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe recursive_check function takes a doc_item parameter of type DocItem and recursively checks if there is any Markdown content stored in the md_content attribute of the doc_item. If the md_content is not empty, the function returns True. Otherwise, it iterates over the children of the doc_item and recursively calls itself on each child until it finds a document with content or reaches the leaf nodes. If no document content is found in any of the nodes, the function returns False.\\n\\nThis function plays a crucial role in traversing the tree structure of DocItem objects to determine if there is any Markdown content present in any of the nodes or their children.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the doc_item parameter passed to the function is a valid DocItem object.\\n- The function relies on the recursive nature of the tree structure to check for document content effectively.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\n- If the md_content attribute of the doc_item contains Markdown content, the function returns True.\\n- If no Markdown content is found in the doc_item or its children, the function returns False.\\n\\nFunctionDef to_markdown(item, now_level)\\n\\nto_markdown: The function of to_markdown is to generate markdown content based on the provided DocItem object and its children recursively.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- item: Represents a DocItem object containing information about a specific item.\\n- now_level: Indicates the current level of the item in the hierarchy.\\n\\nCode Description: The to_markdown function constructs markdown content by processing the information stored in the DocItem object and its children. It starts by creating a header based on the item\\'s type and name. If the item has parameters, they are included in the header. The function then appends the last content of the item (if available) and recursively processes its children to generate a hierarchical markdown structure. Each child is processed with an increased level indicator to maintain the hierarchy. A horizontal rule is added after each child\\'s content.\\n\\nThe function utilizes the to_str method from the DocItemType class to convert the item\\'s type to a string representation. This conversion helps in including the type information in the generated markdown content.\\n\\nNote: It is crucial to ensure that the DocItemType values are correctly defined to match the expected types in the to_str function. Any additional DocItemType values added in the future should be handled to prevent unexpected behavior.\\n\\nOutput Example: \\n```\\n\\nClassDef ExampleClass\\n\\nClass documentation content...\\n\\nFunctionDef example_function(param1, param2)\\n\\nFunction documentation content...\\n\\n```\\n\\nFunctionDef git_commit(self, commit_message)\\n\\ngit_commit: The function of git_commit is to commit changes to a Git repository with a specified commit message.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- commit_message: A string representing the message for the commit.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe git_commit function utilizes the subprocess module to execute a Git commit command with the provided commit message. It attempts to commit changes to the Git repository using the specified message. If the commit operation encounters an error, it catches the subprocess.CalledProcessError exception and prints an error message indicating the failure.\\n\\nNote:\\nDevelopers using this function should ensure that the commit_message parameter is provided as a string to describe the changes being committed to the repository. Additionally, they should handle any potential errors that may arise during the commit process.\\n\\nFunctionDef run(self)\\n\\nAn unknown error occurred while generating this documentation after many tries.\\n\\nFunctionDef add_new_item(self, file_handler, json_data)\\n\\nadd_new_item: The function of add_new_item is to add new projects to the JSON file and generate corresponding documentation.\\n\\nparameters:\\n- file_handler (FileHandler): The file handler object for reading and writing files.\\n- json_data (dict): The JSON data storing the project structure information.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe add_new_item function is responsible for adding new projects to the JSON file and generating the corresponding documentation. It takes two parameters: file_handler, which is an object that handles file operations such as reading and writing, and json_data, which is a dictionary that stores the project structure information.\\n\\nWithin the function, a file_dict is created to store the objects within the file. The function iterates through the objects in the file using the get_functions_and_classes method of the file_handler object. For each object, it retrieves the code information using the get_obj_code_info method of the file_handler object. It then generates documentation for the code using the generate_doc method of the chat_engine object. The generated documentation is stored in the md_content field of the code_info dictionary.\\n\\nThe file_dict is updated with the code_info dictionary, using the name of the object as the key. The json_data dictionary is updated with the file_dict, using the file_handler.file_path as the key. The updated json_data is then written back to the JSON file.\\n\\nNext, the function converts the updated json_data into markdown format using the convert_to_markdown_file method of the file_handler object. The markdown content is then written to a .md file using the write_file method of the file_handler object.\\n\\nFinally, the function logs the completion of the process by outputting the file path and the corresponding actions taken.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Ensure that the file_handler object is properly initialized with the correct repo_path and file_path.\\n- The function relies on the file_handler object to read and write files, as well as retrieve code information and convert it to markdown format.\\n- The json_data dictionary should contain the necessary project structure information before calling this function.\\n- The function updates the json_data and writes it back to the JSON file, as well as generates and writes the markdown documentation for the new projects.\\n- It is important to note that the function relies on the chat_engine object to generate the documentation for the code objects. Ensure that the chat_engine object is properly initialized and configured before calling this function.\\n\\nFunctionDef process_file_changes(self, repo_path, file_path, is_new_file)\\n\\nprocess_file_changes: The function of process_file_changes is to process changed files according to the absolute file path, including new files and existing files. It takes the repo_path, file_path, and is_new_file as input parameters. The repo_path is the path to the repository, file_path is the relative path to the file, and is_new_file indicates whether the file is new or not.\\n\\nThe function begins by creating a FileHandler object, file_handler, to handle file operations for the changed file. It then reads the content of the file using the read_file method of the file_handler.\\n\\nNext, the function uses the change_detector object to parse the differences in the file using the parse_diffs method. It retrieves the changed lines and identifies the changes in the file structure using the identify_changes_in_structure method.

For each key-value pair, it appends the key with the appropriate level of indentation to the output string. If the value is another dictionary, the function recursively calls itself with the nested dictionary and increments the indentation level. This process continues until all nested dictionaries are converted into the string representation.\\n\\nNote:\\n- Make sure to provide a nested dictionary as input to properly utilize this function.\\n- The function uses recursion to handle nested dictionaries, so ensure that the input dictionary is not too deeply nested to avoid potential stack overflow issues.\\n\\nOutput Example:\\nroot\\n    folder1\\n        file1\\n        file2\\n    folder2\\n        subfolder1\\n            file3'), Document(metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\reply\\\\RepoAgent\\\\markdown_docs\\\\tests\\\\test_vectordb.md'}, page_content='ClassDef TestChromaManager\\n\\nTestChromaManager: The function of TestChromaManager is to test the functionality of the ChromaManager class methods.\\n\\nattributes:\\n- self.mock_client: Mock object representing the ChromaDB Client.\\n- self.mock_collection: Mock object representing the collection in ChromaDB.\\n- self.chroma_manager: Instance of ChromaManager class with dummy API key and base.\\n\\nCode Description:\\nThe TestChromaManager class is a unit test class that tests the functionality of the ChromaManager class methods.
